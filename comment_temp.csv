5,2017-01-01 08:50:42,"On the eve of New Year's Eve (New Year's Eve eve?), I had a 3 am extensive conversation about exactly this with a friend as we tried to sober up. We're very exciting people when we party.

He's not a redditor, so we were discussing the general terms - not the subs specifically. He has no horse in the race of what sub is the superior sub. Full disclaimer: I do. I love /r/financialindependence, I dip my toes in /r/personalfinance. But I can only take so much of it, since I'm really here to learn about and share the more narrow, focused ideas of this sub.

Which leads me to our agreed conclusion: financial independence is a subset of personal finance, not a separate topic. PF is a more general field of study, with FI being one possible school of thought within it. Like ""economics"" vs. ""Austrian economics.""

Then to your question: FI tactics - as a ""get rich slowly"" scheme within the broad umbrella of PF - are extremely likely to focus on low risk investment, maximized at the expense of general consumer spending and Keeping Up With The Joneses. PF by no means has to involve the same low risk investments (even though the same are often recommended) and in no way implies a reduction in consumer spending. A completely appropriate PF question would be ""How big a pile of bullshit can I afford? Neighbor just got a huge steaming pile, and I enviously smell it all the time. I want my own but I'm not sure how much bullshit I can finance on X salary with Y mortgage payment and Z savings goal."" The corollary in FI is more like ""Neighbor just bought a big pile of bullshit. Why would you do that when you could have sweet, sweet low-cost index funds with Vanguard and buy cow pies for life?"""

The good news is that it's very easy to turn this around with basic budgeting and a plan. This is your money. You are in control of it.

19,2017-01-01 17:41:38,"Tried that with my last support gig some years ago. A router from the bank that handled all CC transactions went down around the same time for a few days, for around 15 minutes. Tracked down the issue and the solution, which had been in place for years as explained by my old manager, was to contact one of the higher ups in finance to call the bank's IT department to get it fixed because we had 0 access to this router. Anyone who did could view any and all financial transactions that went through it.

My new boss, despite having been told this was the protocol and had been in place for years, told me to get the contact info from whomever had it and that I'd be the point person for issues like this, as non-IT departments shouldn't be calling third party IT departments. Told her I didn't entirely disagree with her, but we'd have to meet with everyone involved (pretty sure this included someone in a V level position in the finance department) to lay out a new chain of command for these issues. Told me to just do it, told her I wouldn't without the meeting, so she takes all financial apps I'm responsible for away from me right then and there.

Doesn't give me anything to replace the work I'm no longer responsible for, and terminates me about 6 months later saying I was wasting time on the tasks she did leave me and thus wasn't focused on improving and doing my job.

And that's only half the story.

27,2017-01-01 20:49:51,"I don't even know where to begin telling you why this is not the case.  This is /r/badeconomics in a nutshell. 

(1) Citation about those recoveries that occurred without any government spending whatsoever?

(2) Citation that individuals were in the same position to stimulate the economy as a whole as was the government?

(3) This is just some dumb bitcoin libertarian nonsense talking point that doesn't hold up to the slightest scrutiny.  

(a) Market inflation is inevitable, at least as long as markets are not completely closed systems.

(b) When bonds come due, governments simply issue more bonds to finance their redemption; they rolled over the debt.  That’s what happens in 99% of the cases in every modern economy, and you can see this by looking at how small and infrequent fiscal surpluses actually are.

(c) All government economic activity is about borrowing from some people to pay other people, and paying back these debts -- should it ever happen, which it will not -- simply reverses that flow.  Either way, money is transferred from one group to another at the same point in time.

(d) Austerity would have been the worst of all options, as European countries that leaned into austerity like Spain demonstrate.  If capital markets are frozen because nobody in the private sector has an incentive to spend for fear of devaluing their currency holdings, then *nobody will spend anything, ever.*

(e) The amount of 'borrowing' (either from other countries or the nebulous future) to finance fiscal deficits is not any kind of direct function of the deficit size but of whatever determines the government's position for repayment -- that is, current and capital accounts.  It might be true in some circumstances, but to make the case that government borrowing automatically increases the account deficit, you have to, you know, actually make the case instead of supposing it.

(f) Obviously, deficits aren't completely great or free of problems. The selling of bonds and the permission structure that allows those bonds to be fulfilled have to be stable, but that's far less difficult than the converse -- where private markets have to spontaneously find the means and incentives to pull themselves out of a spending freeze without any government-backed guarantees in the form of bonds.

**For individuals, borrowing is truly borrowing from the future since their repayment must occur in a closed system -- their own finances.  At the population level, borrowing is necessary to create assets and liabilities across different people, times, markets, and material circumstances.  Those two are not the same.  Your argument relies on an analogy that does not hold up to even the slightest scrutiny.**"

31,2017-01-01 11:04:01,"I don't think so. I'm assuming that by 'our generation' you mean millennials. But here is a few reasons for thinking that you may be wrong.

* You base much of your hypothesis on the rejection of consumerism, but there is a large part of the self-labeled minimalists that do not abide by this at all. Look at this subreddit even, users are so split on whether it should be about art or lifestyle. in a twist of irony, you've tagged your own post art, further calling out this dichotomy. And so many of the lifestyle posts on this reddit are some variation of ""I want a new minimized _product_, despite my current one being fully functional. Help me pick out an expensive aluminum one"". Subs like /r/anticonsumption and /r/simpleliving are much less popular.

* I don't subscribe to the ""minimalism is only for rich people"" thought, but the most public leaders of the minimalism movement come from rich backgrounds. The minimalists movie for example, those guys had 6 figure jobs before they started the whole thing. And now they've just made a movie that seemed to me to be an ad for their book. This takes away from the central, less sexy, message of minimalism of ""less is more"" and makes it seem less accessible for people. 

* Gathering experiences instead of things is still incredibly commercialized. Many experiences people seek out are simply for social status reasons, similar to goods. What is the difference between spending a ton of money on a watch to post on instagram and spending a ton of money on an incredibly commercialized music festival to post on instagram? To me there is no difference. 

* Personal experiences with my peers tells me that this isn't a huge thing among younger millennials. I feel like I have a wide range of friends, from broke musicians to farmers to people doing very well in technology and finance. Everybody still wants a new toy and has crap they don't need (myself included). It just doesn't feel like a large thing. Everybody knows what it is of course thanks the countless empty-room and kitschy self help blogs out there, but to many young people that's exactly what it feels like - empty rooms and kitschy self help blogs.

Just some thoughts"
32,2017-01-01 12:20:19,"I went to Torres del Paine and El Calafate for the following week (second time, I went 15 years ago as well), and while there's absolutely a lot of extremely pretty scenery there, I enjoyed my time on the Carretera Austral more. I agree that few places compare to the magnificent granite towers of Paine and, further north, Fitz Roy, but they are far from the only hugely scenic spots in Patagonia. 

Arriving in Coyhaique felt much like arriving in Puerto Natales 15 years ago. There's a bit of that final frontier atmosphere to be had, which simply is just not there in Puerto Natales anymore. We had a meal at a pizzeria, and I swear that every single other seat in that pizzeria was occupied by a US citizen wearing brand new hiking boots, cool sunglasses and a North Face winter jacket. There's of course nothing wrong with that, I'm just putting it forward as ""proof"" that Torres del Paine is currently THE place to go for a lot of tourists, even though there are amazing alternatives nearby, where the ""in-crowd"" tourists are hardly seen. 

Another factor to consider is that unless you're on a short trip, or you're extremely good at planning long-lasting trips, and sticking to that plan, Torres del Paine is almost a no-go zone these days. You have to book every camp site or other accommodation in the park, or even near the park, months in advance. And the rates that a few days at even a simple hotel room go for could finance weeks and weeks of travel elsewhere in South America. 

I'm not trying to make people stop going to Torres del Paine, by all means. I'm just suggesting an alternative that some travelers may not have considered, because they don't know about it.

That said, here are some examples of the kind of scenery you will find along the Carretera Austral, well worth image-googling:

- Cerro Castello Patagonia
- San Rafael glacier
- Jeinimeni national reserve
- Parque Queulat
- Glacier O’Higgins

&gt; Russia attempted to sway 36 foreign elections from the end of World War II to the turn of the century - meaning that, in total, at least one of the two great powers of the 20th century intervened in about 1 of every 9 competitive, national-level executive elections in that time period.

&gt; Throughout the Cold War, U.S. involvement in foreign elections was mainly motivated by the goal of containing communism, said Thomas Carothers, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

&gt; The New York Times reported in the 1990s that the CIA had on its payroll members of the military junta that would ultimately unseat Aristide after he was democratically elected in a landslide over Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official and finance minister favored by the U.S. The U.S. also attempted to sway Russian elections.

The only difference being we will probably hear Stannis' inner monologue about what's happening. As for his tactics he says plenty of times he won't run and be known as ""the king who runs"" his lack of men and lack of finance, what would he do? Return to the wall and have all the events leading to what happens to Jon just not happening. The northern lords wouldn't ever support Stannis so he would always been in the same position and he would die one way or another. However as for the Brienne thing I agree it's total shit she ""kills"" him and declares Renley is the true king when he never was. 

As for Barristan there's no way of knowing that exact day is the day the sons will come out and slaughter unsullied, yes there is always a risk of an attack but he's the best Swordfighter in the world so there's no way he couldn't handle himself. He didn't have any armour since removing it in season 1, they could of made him some but then you run into production budget. You also have to think that Selmy went without his armour to sounds of conflict (a noble and brave thing to do) and then on top of all that almost killed every one of the sons of Harpy in front of him. Yes he died in a back alley to unknown people but not every hero dies valiantly in a battle or duel and his death shows that.  

As for Blackfish he got the Stannis treatment, they didn't show his death on screen just in case they want to bring him back in later (yes it's unlikely this will happen with either but it could happen). Also how long do you think these old knights and commanders could last in the long night? The walkers come and these slow men would die by the dozen so there's not any reason to think they could get a more honourable death elsewhere. 

Overall you have to remember D.B and D.B.W are following guidelines laid out by George so in his next book (whenever that comes) I'm expecting a lot of this to happen. "

48,2017-01-01 11:58:55,"Personally, I have no problems with dynasts in BJP. Most of them are more competent than those who have been educated in RSS shakhas who tend to have dangerous far-right ideologies. I was responding to Poonam Mahajan's hypocrisy. But to call BJP a party which selects dynasts on merit would be very naive. 

Also, what qualifies as top leadership? Does BJP not have intra-party democracy? Top leadership excuse for dynastic politics would be applicable if we lived in a dictatorship. Some of these BJP leaders promoting their relatives are cabinet ministers. They have a lot of say within the party and have a lot of support in their constituencies. Modi cannot fire people at will. 


&gt;Thirty two-year-old Abhishek Singh, BJP’s candidate from Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, is a post-graduate from XLRI Jamshedpur. His political experience is limited to assisting his father, and yet, he edged out the current BJP MP from the constituency, Madhsudhan Yadav. A senior leader who won the 2009 elections with a thumping margin of 119,074 votes, Yadav stood a bright chance of winning again, according to political observers in the state. “But it was difficult to turn down Abhishek’s name since Ramanji has won three elections for the party,” said a BJP leader in Chhattisgarh, on the condition of anonymity.

&gt;Another chief minister who wrested three victories for BJP could be similarly rewarded. Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s wife is likely to get a ticket to contest the Madhya Pradesh assembly by-election from Vidisha. In the assembly polls in December, Chouhan had contested and won from two constituencies – Budhni and Vidisha. He retained Budhni and gave up Vidisha. But it appears the constituency might well remain within the family.

&gt;You don’t need to win three consecutive elections for the BJP to get a party ticket for a family member. Jayant Sinha, the son of Yashwant Sinha, a senior BJP leader who has served as India’s finance minister, is in the fray from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand. An alumnus of IIT and Harvard Business School, 50-year-old Jayant Sinha has had a long and successful corporate career, but as a disgruntled BJP worker told Hindustan Times, “Degrees from international universities are no criteria to become a popular politician and good administrator.”

&gt;Another political scion fielded by the BJP is Anurag Thakur, the son of former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal. Anurag Thakur has been re-nominated from Hamirpur, which he won in 2009.

&gt;Dushyant Singh, the son of Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, is also likely to get re-nominated from Jhalawar constituency. Dushyant Singh won the assembly polls in 2004 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2009.

&gt;A BJP spokesperson, who did not wish to be named, said the party could not ignore the ""winnability"" of political scions. But that does not explain why even those who have lost elections for the party have been rewarded with tickets. Poonam Mahajan, the 33-year-old daughter of late Pramod Mahajan, has been nominated by BJP from Mumbai North-West constituency, even though she lost the 2009 assembly polls by a margin of 24,966 votes.

I never became foaming-at-the-mouth angry with Warren and her lack of backbone during the primaries (and since), but I am getting sick of everyone labeling progressive democrats as ""the Sanders and Warren wing"" of the party.  Stop trying to make that happen, democrats.  Warren is good on finance, and that's about it.

53,2017-01-01 14:13:36,"I'm probably a unique case here.  I'm the 41yo single dad of a 22yo boy.

I started out as a teenage parent, living in subsidized housing and using WIC checks, and then became a single parent.  I used federal student loans and a massive amount of personal finance to go from public assistance to buying a home in ~6 years, and ~20 years later I've paid far more back into the system than I took from it.

For years after my son left for college, I didn't know what to do with myself.  This year I actually started getting hobbies and vacationed by myself.  Next year is actually looking good for me, as I will be selling a house and some stock that should total ~$400k cash at the end.  The house I live in is paid off, and it's a two family which provides income from a tenant family that's unlikely to move any time soon.  My son's college already has money set aside for it.  This first family that I was a part of seems to have run its course.

My financial goal for next year?  To start a new relationship so that I'm not spending holidays alone until I'm an old man.  Lol...this might not seem like a personal finance goal, but money sure does seem to be involved.

For example, the old/abused vehicle that I'm driving right now, is likely the wrong choice for picking up a date.  And although I have a lot of people telling me ""losing your hair isn't a big deal,"" it is to my confidence and it's a matter of money to fix that problem.  In general I'm going to need to get used to spending money during the dating process...ugh...but at this point my mind is so settled into the ""minimize weekly shopping expenses"" mode.

Here's a another question: could I possibly have accumulated enough at this point, if I find someone and they want a family, I might be able to be a stay-at-home dad?  I'd *love* a chance to do that if I could.  I did the best I could as a single dad, but it killed me to see all the ways my son suffered as a result of me having to take two roles.  I have a modest 401k and no debts, but my stock sale next year should be guaranteed and the real estate agents I interviewed had data showing my house should sell quickly.

I'd sort of like to ask this as a question by itself, but I'm unsure of if it's appropriate for /r/personalfinance in the first place."
54,2017-01-01 16:24:04,"The new owner, Mike Charlesworth came in towards the end of Arnie's reign and has since taken a bottom up approach towards reshaping the club and its finances.

Arnie left the club in a financial mess and the wages weren't sustainable, despite the on field success. Having said that, somebody had to greenlight all of his finance related requests, so it wasn't just him. 

During the the tenures of Phill Moss, Tony Walmsley and now Paul Okon, Charlesworth has worked to reduce spending and increase revenue in order to balance the books. A lot of this was done when Walmsley was at the club and it has been well documented that CCM has been spending the lowest amount of the allocated salary cap in the entire comp. 

So as far as the on field performances are concerned, you can only play the cards you are dealt and the cards were not good. However, with news about CCM wanting to purchase Central Coast Stadium and also looking to implement a W-league team, it can be noted that Charlesworth isn't afraid to invest in the team, he just wants it to be sustainable at the same time. He's building the foundations now, before more expansions occur and farther down the line, relegation. 

The goal of producing young talent to then sell on to an overseas club is still prevalent and in my opinion, wisely so due to the nature of our league and the small size of the central coast population. Praise has to go to the CCM fans who are still attending matches because it can't be easy, but i'm sure their patience will eventually be rewarded. If the team ends up reaching the lofty heights of their past it won't be for a few years yet, but at least they'll be able to pay their players during the championship season. I remember reading Arnie had to write a few cheques to some of his players...

If any proper CCM fan wants to comment or disagree, be my guest, I just have a soft spot for this team and have followed them very closely. Also forgive my formatting/spelling, i'm on my iphone.

Don't. Financial advisers are mostly just salesmen, and most sell shitty products with high fees. It's impossible to navigate which ones are good and which ones aren't unless you know finance yourself, in which case, you will no longer need a financial adviser and can invest yourself for the lowest fees (use Vanguard for the lowest fees).

 It's really not all that complicated to invest if you play the game of diversification and just try to get the average market return. Trying to beat the market is another game (a game which we who are interested in bitcoin are playing) and takes another level of sophistication. 

Just read these two books and you'll know all you need to know to invest your own money well for the lowest fees. That is if you're playing the simple diversify-and-get-average-market-return game.

70,2017-01-01 13:27:23,"&gt;Not all financial advisers are salesmen in the way you're trying to imply.

98% are, and someone who doesn't know finance won't know the difference. The problem with the industry is the profit motive. It's much more profitable to sell high-fee products than to try to do the right thing and charge your clients a flat fee to manage their money. I know this because I was used to be in the industry. 

Being a financial adviser is a very difficult profession. It's almost impossible to launch a career doing the right thing. It's much easier to make it when you can make many thousands off each client by selling them a high-commission product. 

The reason is two fold. First, it's much easier to convince someone to work with you if they don't have to pay you directly. Commissions are somewhat hidden from the consumer and consumers are conditioned to pay them without thinking about it too much. It's much more difficult to get a client to understand that by paying you $100 an hour, they'll pay less in the long run.

Second, clients are *very* hard to acquire. There is intense competition and marketing cost a lot of money. So if you can make 3-10x more money per client by offering a high-commission item, you'll be much more likely to make it in the industry. It's survival of the fittest and it's about the survival of the adviser, not what's in the best interest of the client. Guys with good intentions die off much faster than guys who look after their bottom line first. 

There is massive infrastructure and marketing organizations available to guys who sell high-commission items. There is very little support available to the guys who charge by the hour for advice. They are on their own and are at a big disadvantage in the marketplace. As such, 98% or more of financial advisers are nothing more than salesmen who sell expensive products.

Sorry pal, I know the red pill is hard to take, but this is the way things are in the financial services industry. Research it for yourself, it won't take you long to find out that I'm right. It just is the way it is. The world is not a kind place and the profit motive corrupts many industries. Finance is one of the worst.

Edit: I just want to add that most financial advisers don't know that they are nothing more than simple salesmen. Field marketing organizations spend a ton of money each year to pour their advisers a ton of kool aid to condition them as thoroughly as they do the consumer. Most don't have a background in finance and are just doing what they think is right. They usually get hired by an FMO to get their start and the FMO trains them in their way of thinking that maximizes the goals of the FMO. FMOs spend millions on world-class copywriters to craft a persuasive narrative that the advisers can stomach and pass on to the consumers."

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/in-their-own-words-sunnis-on-their-treatment-in-malikis-iraq/

&gt;Rafi al-Essawi was the minister of finance in Maliki’s cabinet, a figure who was “greatly respected” by many Iraqis, according to journalist Dexter Filkins. Almost exactly a year after Hashemi’s bodyguards were rounded up, Maliki’s security forces arrested Essawi’s bodyguards on similar allegations of ties to terrorism. The move triggered huge protests in Sunni parts of Iraq, because as Filkins said, “everybody knows Rafi al-Essawi is a peaceful man.” Fearing he would be arrested like Hashemi, Essawi fled to the Sunni-dominated city of Ramadi.

&gt;Maliki — he had to get rid of all Sunni politicians who were capable of saying no to him, his policies or his behavior. So it’s the story of attacking, intimidating, marginalizing, whatever you want, of Sunni politicians.

&gt;RAFI AL-ESSAWI: Thousands of Sunnis were arrested after the Americans left the country, tens of thousands in fact. They come to any district with a car bombing, for example. They’re collecting 200, 300 people and they stay in [prison] for years without a trial.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/28/what-we-left-behind

&gt;For more than a year, thousands of Iraqis, nearly all of them members of the Sunni Arab minority, had been gathering to rail against Maliki’s Shiite-dominated government. Although the protests were mostly peaceful, security forces responded harshly, detaining thousands of Sunni men without charges and, in one encampment, touching off a spasm of violence that left hundreds of civilians dead. Across the Sunni heartland, north and west of Baghdad, the town squares filled with angry crowds, and the rhetoric grew more extreme. In Ramadi, protesters raised black jihadi flags, representing the extremist Al Qaeda offshoot that had dominated the city during the American occupation. “We are a group called Al Qaeda!” a man shouted from a stage in the protesters’ camp. “We will cut off heads and bring justice!” The crowd cheered.

77,2017-01-01 15:20:11,What's your finance question? 
78,2017-01-01 16:47:56,"[The company's market cap is £981.21M](http://www.google.co.uk/finance?q=LON:GRG), so we could afford it in under 3 weeks."
79,2017-01-01 06:45:35,"State records start in 1870 (Baden), 1874 (Prussia) or 1876 (rest of Germany), unless your ancestor was from the area left of the Rhine, which introduced them under Napoleonic rule around 1800. Registrar's offices will keep birth records for 110 years, marriage records for 80 years and death records for 30 years; after that, the records are moved to the state archives. Churchbooks were kept starting from the 1500s, although many early ones were destroyed during the reformation and the 30 Years' War. Churchbooks are divided by religion (i.e. you have to know whether your ancestors were Evangelicals (Lutherans), Catholics or Jews). 

This means that if your ancestor emigrated in more recent times, you should start out by applying for any certificates you know the dates and places of by submitting proof that you are indeed directly related. This should give you the names of the parents - what's important is that you get past that magic data protection barrier. Genealogy is not a valid reason to retrieve records of people you're not directly related to (one exception, I think, is that you can apply for records of indirect ancestors if you are the closest related person, but I'm not quite sure about that). 

Once you reach the time before registrar's offices, state archives and church archives are the way to go. 

Large parts of Germany still live in the pre-digital era, and only a few regions (e.g. Hamburg) have agreements with sites like ancestry.com ($) and familysearch.org (free unless you order microfilms). Catholic archives are the worst, as they usually require you to be present at the archive and won't conduct research for you. I think that so far, only one or two bishoprics have digitalised and published their records.

The following sites may be helpful for German genealogy:

- [archion.de](https://www.archion.de/): Archion is an attempt of the *Evangelical* churches to digitalise all their records. You can look if your parish has already been digitalised. If it has, you can buy a subscription to browse the records. 

- [genealogy.net](http://meta.genealogy.net/): genalogy.net is the largest German genealogical site. It combines many databases and user-submitted data, and can easily searched via the link above. Mind that there may be more results than the site is able to display; if that is so, the affected databases will be listed at the bottom of the search results. The site also has a Wiki with resources for each place, and mailing lists that you can sign up for. 

- [verwandt.de](http://www.verwandt.de/karten/): See where your surname appears today!

- [forum.ahnenforschung.net](http://forum.ahnenforschung.net/): The largest German-language genealogy forum. The interface sadly cannot be changed to any other language, but you'll survive just fine with Google translate. Just post your list of surnames in the appropriate subforum and see if someone is related or can help you out (make sure you subscribe to your threads so as to get notified about any new messages).

One more thing you should know is that pre-1942 records will most definitely be written in printed [Fraktur](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_\(Schrift\)#/media/File:Vollst%C3%A4ndiger_Zeichensatz_\(ohne_Ligaturen\)_Koch-Fraktur.png) and handwritten [Kurrent](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Kurrentschrift#/media/File:Deutsche_Kurrentschrift.svg) scripts, both of which may be difficult for foreigners to read. Hardly any Germans below the age of ~55 can read Kurrent without prior training. *I can translate any records you might find.*

In order to get further than the churchbook limit, you'll have to dig up old tax/tithe lists, local court records etc., which may exist either in local or regional archives.

**Q: Help, I cannot find a place called ""x"" in the region of ""y"", which is stated on my ancestor's immigration / naturalisation / shipping record!**

**A:** This is because the borders of back then are not the same as they are now. Take, for example, the Palatinate region, which is where a large percentage of immigrants came from: for a very long time, parts of this region was a Royal Bavarian exclave. Entering the place name in the German Wikipedia usually yields a list of possible results (make sure you find the disambiguation page for the place name).

**Q: I am looking for military records or a missing person.**

- For members of the former Wehrmacht, one can request all of their records with the [Deutsche Dienststelle \(WASt\)](https://www.dd-wast.de/en/tracing-request/private-matters-research.html). However, [it is not possible to obtain records of *surviving* combatants without their permission.](https://www.dd-wast.de/en/competence.html) It is only possible to obtain information on members of the former Wehrmacht who died either in the field or in captivity, and that only with permission from the next of kin. However, the Forum der Wehrmacht suggests that if the person in question has been dead for 10 years (even if they survived the war), the WASt will hand out info to the direct descendants. If the person had no direct descendants or the direct line has died off, it is also possible for the indirect line (nephews etc.) to obtain records; however, they need to be able to provide accurate info on the family status of the person in question. The costs for one record usually amount to about 20€, according to the website (a friend of mine paid 30). It depends on the difficulty and amount of records requested. The waiting time for a full genealogical inquiry might be more than 24 months, so it may be good to have a very distinct goal in mind, e.g. an inquiry into where someone's death certificate may be located. That reduces the time. If you want to know everything there is, make sure to mention in your application that you'd like the WASt ""to find out as much as possible about your relatives"" and that ""copies of records, letters and documents would also be welcome and that you are aware of the additional costs"" (copies are cheap, it's absolutely worth it). 

- The [German Red Cross Tracing Service](https://www.drk-suchdienst.de/en/initiate-tracing-requests) offers services that allow one to trace any missing person, be it civilian or military. This may not be the best place to look for military records, but it is a good start nonetheless. It also has a [""missing person photo search"" service](http://193.159.223.62:8081/vbl/), for which one only needs to enter some piece of information.

- [Federal Archive - Branch Office Ludwigsburg](http://www.bundesarchiv.de/bundesarchiv/dienstorte/ludwigsburg/index.html.en) (Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, e-mail: ludwigsburg@bundesarchiv.de): This archive houses data on units involved in war crimes, the scenes of these crimes, suspects and culprits, as well as persons who were mentioned in the investigations of said crimes. Therefore, it might be useful to check these archives if the searched person was part of units suspected of war crimes. 

- [Federal Archive - Department MA](https://www.bundesarchiv.de/bundesarchiv/organisation/abteilung_ma/index.html.en) (Military Archives): These archives house files on  
the Prussian army from 1867 onwards  
the army of the North German Confederation  
the Imperial Navy  
the colonial protection force and the Freikorps  
the Reichswehr, Wehrmacht, and Waffen-SS  
the German work units in the service of the allied forces  
the National People's Army, including border troops  
the Bundeswehr  
However, this needs to be taken with a grain of salt - the Department MA has lost vast amounts of its files due to war. Most of the files are war diaries written by army commanders and files on the navy. 

- Federal Archive - [Department R \(Reich\)](http://www.bundesarchiv.de/bundesarchiv/organisation/abteilung_r/index.html.en): Last straw. Has the largest pool of documents (from almost all eras), but these are mainly of a civil administrative nature (justice, finance, etc.).

- [Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge e. V.](http://www.volksbund.de/en/volksbund.html): Useful for looking for war graves. "

&gt; Lester Burnham is a loser suburbanite rebelling against his dead-end job, bitch-on-wheels wife, unloving daughter, and imminent middle-age. His subsequent actions unfold into a darkly comic drama laced with a stellar supporting cast and enough roses to fill a nursery.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Writing in Variety, Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble ""could not be better""; he praised Spacey's ""handling of innuendo, subtle sarcasm, and blunt talk"" and the way he imbued Lester with ""genuine feeling"". Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his ""wittiest and most agile"" to date, and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who ""does reckless and foolish things \[but who\] doesn't deceive himself"". Kevin Jackson of Sight &amp; Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances, the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of ""both sap and hero"". Writing in Film Quarterly, Gary Hentzi praised the actors, but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts were stereotypes. Hentzi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky, saying the latter was their ""fantasy figure""—a teenaged boy who's an absurdly wealthy artist able to ""finance \[his\] own projects"". Hentzi said Angela was the most believable teenager, in particular with her ""painfully familiar"" attempts to ""live up to an unworthy image of herself"". Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal, but said their detailed characterizations made them memorable. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the actors coped ""faultlessly"" with what were difficult roles; he called Spacey's performance ""the energy that drives the film"", saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic. ""Against considerable odds, we do like \[these characters\],"" Turan concluded.

89,2017-01-01 00:29:53,"Sure, I don't like to do AMA's because there is a strong anti-wall street sentiment there, and there have been other AMA's, so most of what I have to say is repetition. Firstly, it depends on GPA, that of course determines what college you get into. In High School I worked my ass off, I ended high school with a 4.3 GPA, started a finance club, acted, fenced, and I am (in name) hispanic. What I mean by that is that I am 25% Mexican, just Mexican enough to put hispanic on college applications, but also I look white. This provides an advantage, because almost all the interviewers at hedge funds are white as well. They aren't openly racist or anything, its just an almost universal trend that people tend to identify more with the same race. However I'm going off topic, I undergraded at William and Mary, for a few reasons.

1. They have a great business school.

2. I am from VA, so I got instate tuition.

3. They are a great school overall.

That being said, I got into great schools, princeton, harvard, MIT, but I wanted my undergrad for myself

At William and Mary I double majored in Computer Science and Economics. 

However I've also received my MBA. From Columbia. I decided on columbia for a few reasons.

1. Obviously, great school, ranked 4th in the US.

2. It let me be in New York, and I wanted to get a feel for the city, as hedge funds are quite prominent in NYC. 

I interviewed for an intern position after college with Bridgewater associates, which is ironically not based in NYC, but in Westport Connecticut. To answer one question, the college didn't really, but they were impressed that I had both economics and business knowledge as well as computer experience. What they really liked is that I had an MBA from an Ivy. They love that, because many of the chief officers have those. Also, a tip I learned. Dress for it, and talk for it. I've heard stories of people who tried to be the ""hipster finance guru"", and show up in ripped jeans and a t shirt. Don't do that. Try and mimic the guy your interviewing, act like you would if you were his friend. To answer the question about the overworked wall street grunt, yes and no. Like I said, the senior employees don't treat you like scum, and you feel like you are contributing, you aren't getting them coffee. However, while it isn't explicitly stated, you are expected to come early and stay late, though how hard depends on whether you really want to climb. Make it a goal to befriend your coworkers and bosses, hedgefunds are fairly small enterprises in terms of number of employees, relatively anyway. So recommendations from experienced employees are worth a lot. The money is quite good. I've been working there for 2.5 years, and am well on my way to being a portfolio manager, which would provide quite the pay raise. I'm also paying back my parents for all my schooling expenses that my 529 plan couldn't cover. 

So to answer your questions: I attended William and Mary for undergrad and Columbia for my MBA. My grad school impressed the interviewer. In many ways the stereotype is right, but if you want to work at a hedge fund, you are probably hardworking anyway, so its not horrible.

If you have more questions feel free to ask or PM me.

90,2017-01-01 10:45:26,"I think this sounds best.

Don't suppose you've read Pratchett's Small Gods have you? Very interesting ideas in terms of gods, how they subsist and come about and their relationships with their believers in that book.

At any rate, if you're having these gods be like standard D&amp;D gods (i.e. not opposed to actually talking to their worshippers) i'd say have them act a just as much eccentricity as their origins would suggest.

Sort of like Magic Hermit Crabs, people started believing in these ideas, and belief has power, so something came or grew to fill it. Maybe some of them were just minor spirits who found a niche, maybe some of them were born from the belief itself, and maybe some are surviving gods from other faiths - pre-apocalypse or post, since a thousands of years is a long time - who managed to hang on for long enough to find a new wellspring in faith.

Now you have these god things inhabiting the shell of their belief, but with identities torn and confused between whatever their true origins might be, whatever they know of their shells origins of the old pre-apocalypse world, and whatever humans might actually believe of them.

The people of the wasteland might indeed worship the twin gods of Heckler &amp; Kosch as the Lawful Evil gods of War &amp; Finance - who are joined together like siamese twins as some no doubt clever religious metaphor. They preach reliable businesslike professionalism in war (think Hitman, Assassins Creed, Lord of War; that sort of consummate professional killer who scorns unnecessary killing as pointless but has no issues with mass murder if it *does* have a point) and are also worshipped by those who believe in the honesty of contracts and the punishment of oath breakers.

 The gods themselves however might in their past lives have been a some raving barbarian god of war who's tribe was wiped out and a peaceful &amp; beneveolent god of Law, Merchants and Cities. Both now squeezed into their new guises of armani suits, sunglasses and machine pistols - and trapped in a odd couple relationship with one another to survive on the new faith.

They know the values of what they used to be, they have an idea of what Heckler &amp; Kosch stood for, and they know what their worshippers think they are. And they are very confused.

You could have a lot of fun with this if you wanted to. I imagine some very exacerbated priests."

I like it here.  There are some downsides, but I couldn't picture myself living anywhere else for a good while.

I'm incredibly picky but have access to almost anything I could want in New York.  Depending on your interests/lifestyle, that could fuel some very materialistic habits or be a great resource.  Generally though, things here are better quality if you can afford them.

Big upside for me is that I like walking around and watching people.  The parks are beautiful.  The vegan food is awesome.  Life looks and feels like a movie a lot of the time.  I can wear all black and not smile all day and no one will call me out for it.  I can embarrass myself and remain anonymous.  People stop caring about privacy and you will witness their intimate moments.  A girl will squat piss in front of you and not care.  A man will be playing a saxophone.

There are a lot of talented people here, which is inspiring but can also be crushing knowing you will never weigh up, knowing you will never be as efficient, letting yourself waste your own time.  It will discourage you or make you try harder.  You will raise your standards and develop your taste.

There are also a lot of social climbers and young professional types who don't understand subcultures but move to Brooklyn and become ""creative.""  It bothers me.  Other downsides:  Filth, limited space, bad produce, everything being so expensive.  It can be hard to have ""think time.""

I do finance/accounting for a photo studio which is a pretty interesting environment.  Another huge perk for me in New York is the media production industries.  Basically I can work in finance (which I can do decently well) but still be in a flexible, creative environment with people I'm mentally in line with (a lot of N types).

More downsides:  I feel like my life is my job.  I'm incredibly isolated and lonely.  I have friends here, but not friends that I'm deeply connected with.  Everyone is busy and has their own thing going on, and I'm not one to reach out and make plans.  I'm not sure if this is adulthood or a phase, but damn, it's rough.

98,2017-01-01 23:32:34,"The short answer about voiding your warranty is no.

The long answer is the expression itself ""void your warranty"" is inaccurate. The correct interpretation is the manufacturer can deny a warranty claim if it is proven to be the direct result of an unapproved repair.  So in this example:  If Costco broke a wheel stud while changing your tire it would not be covered under your factory warranty, but nothing else regarding your warranty changes. If your power window motor stops working next week it is in no way related to the tire change and would be honored.    

Also, you are better off buying your tires yourself for many reasons.  1. The dealership tires I've seen offered are shit (winter claw or some other no name brand). X-ice and blizzacks from Costco are top rated tires year after year by the APA. 2. You also don't want to finance a consumable that will probably wear out before you've paid for them (getting 3 years on a set of tires but you're paying for them for 5 years).    Do yourself a favor though and buy rims.  "
