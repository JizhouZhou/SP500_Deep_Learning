After that ruling, money has since been allowed to flow in complete secrecy from organizations can be detrimental to the needs of the electorate.

Would you support a constitutional amendment that counteracts Citizen's United? Would you go further than that?""


Ask 'em THAT, Larry. I am sure the 3rd parties would love to talk about how raising money is the biggest impediment to success for them. The audience will also like to hear about how these candidates view the corrupting effect of big money on the electoral process. I personally see campaign finance as one of the top 3 reasons why the country is so fucked up."
1,2012-12-13 11:33:28,"Here's my PSA for the day. You actually **do** have a right to one free (actually free) credit report a year, but you have to go through the government website to get it. You can go [here](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) for details on the process, and it will send you to [annualcreditreport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp).

Edit: Just for clarity, since I've been corrected by a few people, you can get a free report from each of 3 main agencies. They should all say the same thing, though, and the important part is looking for errors or evidence of identity theft. And the free part does not extend to seeing your credit score. 

Edit #2: For extra clarity...

* Your 3 credit reports won't automatically say the same thing. Ideally they would, but the reporting firms function differently. So, it's good to compare the three for inconsistencies. You can look at them all at the same time once a year, or you can get one report from one agency every 4 months and compare with your most recent report.
* Many people are recommending CreditKarma.com. It sounds like it's more of a credit estimator, but I don't really know much about it. I'm in biology, not finance. Don't hurt me! **For information from someone who actually knows things, see [jimbo831's comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14sd9w/what_supposedly_legitimate_things_do_you_think/c7g4u24)**
* Getting a credit report by applying for a loan or a credit card or whatever lowers your score a little bit. The government-allowed once a year report will not lower your score.

2,2012-08-21 09:24:42,"I would say this is actually a very un-useless skill since it can save you majorly, but no point in arguing.  I'm not any sort of haggling expert, but I almost always try.

The best places to try haggling are any large ticket items.  The more expensive an item is, typically, the more you are able to haggle.

**ITEMS TO HAGGLE FOR**

* Cars (purchase/ maintenance / accessories)
* Mattresses
* Furniture
* ANYTHING Pre-owned
* Apartment Rent (not often, but I've done it)
* Cable / Satellite
* One-time Membership Costs (Gym, etc...)
* Electronics? (I've never had any luck, most others here seem to though)
* Hotels (bigger is better, smaller ones tend not to be negotiable)
* Cell Phones (Units / Plans / Accessories)

**PLACES TO HAGGLE**

* Small, local businesses (Some go for it, some don't.  Always try)
* Middle Eastern countries and Eastern European countries.  Basically that whole area.  Asia too.
* Flea Markets / Garage Sales
* Best Buy, apparently
* Mall Kiosks
* Jewelry Stores
* Home Improvement stores (Home Depot, etc...)
* Pawn shops (derr...)
* Music Stores

**PLACES/THINGS TO NOT EVEN TRY**

* Corporations (Walmart, Target, etc...)
* Apartment Utilities (Gas/Electric/Water)
* Businesses who can't handle the cut in profits

Haggling (for me) is more of an attempt than a goal.  I know people who will shop around for places willing to lower the price.  I'm more of a ""I'll see what I can get"" sort of guy.

The best way, honestly, is to just ask.  No one is going to turn you away for trying to haggle.  The worst thing is a they no and you move on.

The best methods I find are the simplest.  Just ask ""Would you be willing to come down on the price?""  Often they'll give you some showmanship and ""ask the manager"" and such.  (Note: They are never talking to the manager on any offer you did not make yourself.)  They will come back with an offer or they might even just open with a ""You know what, we have a special going on now..."".  (Note: They will ALWAYS be running a special.)  You almost always want to ignore that.  If they open by cutting the price down before anything even happens, they are trying to sucker you into that feeling of ""OMG! WHAT A DEAL!!! I'LL TAKE IT NAO! I'M SUCH A SAVVY BUYER!""

This is when you need to step up your own showmanship.  If the item is pre-owned, you're in a better position.  It might seem sleazy but try and look for ANY imperfection.  Even the slightest thing can drastically reduce the worth of an item.  Point it out and make it seem way worse then it is.  You never want to seem impressed with anything about the item in question or any offer they make.  As soon as they see you're impressed, they'll start shoving that aspect down your throat and honestly, it's more annoying and distracting than anything else. But that's mostly the point.  They want you to buy fast and be out the door.

Don't be afraid to make your own offer.  This is where a lot of people get uncomfortable.  This takes practice.  Some places are willing to go as deep as half off on some items (mattresses, I find, are the best for this).  But don't expect that.  If you're starting out, do your research and see what other places are selling similar items for.  When you go into your haggle, you'll be better prepared for a counteroffer.  Name dropping can help your case too, especially if it's with a known competitor.  They want to drive business away from them so when you tell them you're thinking of going there for the better price, they'll be more open to dropping the price more.  Otherwise my rule of thumb (which I don't really have any basis for other than it seems to work pretty well) is offer around 75% of their offer.  This is very flexible with context of the deal, who I'm dealing with and what I'm trying to get but that's a decent starting point a lot of the time.

Don't do what I like to call the reverse auction.  If they offer $500, just coming back with saying ""$300!"" won't get you anywhere.  You need to be able to back up your offer at least a little bit.  Bring up other places offering similar items for a price close to yours.  Bring up imperfections in the item or even just the fact it is pre-owned is enough to bring it down.  The guys in Pawn Stars are awful with this.  They don't give any reasoning for offering even 10% of the seller's asking price and don't give any reasoning for it.  But I hear the show is staged, so it's whatever.  It still bothers me how blatant it is.  If you just come back with an offer like, ""I'll give you $300"" it makes you sound like a pompous ass.  You still want to be friendly and approachable.  You're asking the business to do you a favor.  Make them WANT to cut you a deal by being friendly and open to negotiation.

Now for the king of dealbreakers.  This one simple aspect will gets you HEAVY discounts.  Offer cash.  Business LOVE cash.  Charging costs them money, so by offering cash, literally everyone (except Visa or whatever) wins.  If you're going for a deep offer, offer it in cash.  It makes it so much more appealing to the business.  Also offer to pay in full, if you can.  That is usually preferred over installments.  Some places don't seem to care much, though.  And some others prefer the installment plan since it usually costs more for you in the long run.

I think that'll all I have.  If I think of anything else, I'll add it on later.  Good luck and always try!

**EDIT:** Aiming for group/package buys works well too.  Like I was saying about avoiding the reverse auction, offer alternate deals.  Offer that you'll buy Object A for whatever price, but you'll also buy Object B (which is somehow related or connected to Object A) for whatever other price.  So if you are buying a mattress for $400, offer to buy the mattress for $300 but you'll also get the box spring and mattress pad for another $150.  They make a bigger sale and you get more of what you need for a lower price since you're buying it all at once.

**EDIT 2: To people who hate hagglers -** There are a lot of people saying how they hate customers who haggle.  Don't get me wrong, I understand it can be annoying having a jerk like me bothering you over and over.  Even more so when your business can't afford the cut in profits.  But like I've been trying to say, there are multiple types of hagglers.  There are some who are hard nosed about getting the price they walked in with and there are those who are flexible and everyone in between.  I can't control everyone.  If I could, everyone would probably be dead.  Since I can't I can only apologize on their behalf.  If you tell me ""Price in not negotiable"" I will stop trying.  I'm not going to push for a deal where there is not one to be made.  Other people might not accept that and keep pushing.  My best advice is to be direct and firm, but not a dick about it. You can still make a sale if you try and be honest.  If they refuse to listen, simply ask them to leave or ignore them.  If they are not willing to accept that you set a hard price, they are not worth your time.  

I am not sorry I try to haggle.  I *am* sorry some people are assholes and some of those assholes try to haggle.  The fact that they like to haggle has nothing to do with the fact they are assholes.  Try to understand the distinction.

**EDIT3:** haggle haggle haggle haggle haggle haggle.  It sounds all funny now.  haggle haggle

**EDIT4:** Apparently, you should always finance a car.  I don't know much about that, but a bunch of people here have mentioned it and the Internet is never wrong.

**TL;DR - Always try to haggle haggle**"
3,2012-12-16 16:44:11,"Here are a few that got me

**Consider Getting A Double Major** - It might not always work out, but there are a few situations where it would only be one extra semester to earn a Double Major. I'm going to be graduating in May with a Double Major and I only had to take 6 extra classes. It's like getting two degrees, and then some.

**International Edition Textbooks** - Find them brand new on eBay or amazon for $20-40 instead of buying the used version at the campus store for $120. I've compared textbook bills for a few different semesters and ended up saving nearly 70%.

**Assignment Spreadsheet** - At the beginning of every semester, I create a spreadsheet containing all of the assignments for that semester, what class they are for, and when they are due. I also include reading assignments and exam dates. Once something is done, I just hide the row in the spreadsheet or delete it. Whenever I sit down to do homework, I pull up this list and take a look at what's due in the next week or two.
 
**Calculate Your Grades Constantly** - Similar to the assignment spreadsheet, but I always calculate what my final grade should be throughout the semester. It's always nice to know where you stand on final grades, and it's also nice to put in some hypothetical grades in case there are other classes that you need to focus on.

EDIT: Woot! over 10,000 comments now? Who know this thing would take off like it has. I guess it must be the holiday break coming up or something...

A lot of people have asked for a sample spreadsheet to track assignments. Here's a google docs version for your viewing pleasure - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsflAKMYX97BdFdQbU9IV0tTZUNRV2FqU2FSZlhsVGc - I use one spreadsheet for all of my assignments and classes. It's extremely useful to see them all in one place when I have to decide which assignments to start on right now, and which ones can wait.

Also, there's a lot of discussion about the dual major. While not every combination could be considered beneficial (ie. Anthropology and Corporate Finance) there are some combinations that just end up being better together. My majors are Operations Management and Information Systems. They work so closely together that the extra major ends up being a huge asset in finding employment. I had no clue you could double major until it was almost too late, so I wanted to give some exposure to the idea and I figured it's worth at least considering."

9,2012-10-17 15:59:24,"Jewish lawyer here, and a property lawyer at that. Let me blow your mind:

Medieval finance:  Property owners in medieval times usually had agricultural land (that is, land that produced crops, dairy, and things like this). Serfs (servants) worked the land and in exchange for their work, got to have a nice little home on the land and got to keep a modest share of the agricultural yield for themselves.  The serfs gave the rest of the yield to the landowner.  That rest (the part of the yield the landowner kept) had *value*. 

Now, at the time, people wanted to borrow money, but lenders were reluctant to lend because interest was banned.  (There was no incentive to lend other than being a nice guy, and being a nice guy is bad for business.)  

To get around the usury prohibition, a landowner could get money from a lender by exchanging the ownership of his land (for a period of time) for a for a lump sum of money from the lender.  The lender (the person getting temporary ownership of the land) would get to keep the agricultural yield of the land produced during that period (minus whatever went to the serfs).  If the yield was the *same* as (or limited to) the value of the property, then the temporary owner (the lender) would just get back the value he lent (the principal).  He'd be a nice guy lender.   

But if the yield was *more* than the value of the property, the new owner (the lender) could *keep* that extra value.  (OMG INTEREST baby!) 

The pledge of land was called a ""gage.""

If the land produced just enough yield to repay the loan, it was called a ""live pledge"" (viv-gage).

If the land produced more crops than required to repay the loan, it was called a dead pledge (mort-gage).

**Mort-gage = Mortgage.  The modern mortgage was a tactic derived in medieval Europe to get around the Church's prohibition on usury.**
"
10,2012-10-07 20:54:28,"**On boiling the water**

Cold water. Boil it once. Pour immediately into a teapot (If you are making tea for just yourself a mug is acceptable)
Left over water in the kettle from last time? Throw that shit away.


**On Teapots**

This is *never* cleaned.

* Your friend thinks it would be a great idea to make cocktails in it? *Throw it away.*
* Sick in it? Throw it away
* Cleaned with anything other than just hot water? *Throw it away.*

Your teapot should have a tea cosy, it is frowned upon if this is not chequered or floral. Bonus points if it matches your tea towels. 
&gt;Regarding the tea cosy: it is entirely acceptable, if not required, that you put it on your head and refer yourself as the Bishop. 
(Thanks to iamtheparty)

As pointed out 'warming the pot' is a common practice whereby a small amount of boiled water is added to the tea pot prior to the teabags and swirled around. This is to make sure the tea is piping hot. In my opinion this is not strictly necessary but comes under the banner of 'cocking about'.

**On Mugs**

Teacups and saucers are only used to impress people that you do not want to come to your house.
Use a mug. 

* Mugs should be large, clean and most importantly **yours**
* Not your Dad's
* Not one that you found at the back of the cupboard at your office kitchen, *even* if it is the only one that does not smell like off milk.
* It must be your own mug. There are many like it but this one is yours. You do not use it at 3am when you feel the need for bathroom tap water. You do not use it to keep your stationary in. You do not permit anyone else to use it. This mug is for tea and tea alone.


**On Brands of Tea**

Most people have a preference to which tea brand they like. Personally I'm a big fan of Yorkshire tea. PG tips, in my opinion, are of the devil. If someone were to hand me a cup of it, I would drink it. I'm British anything else would be impolite. We will cover etiquette later.
*Students*
Red label tea from Sainsbury's is fantastic for its cost.

**On Tea Leaves**

Some people have got the time to make loose leaf tea. Well done you. How was art school? I also like loose leaf tea. I drink it when I have nothing better to do or am at a tea shop and have the leisure time to deal with loose leaf. On the whole though, teabags will suffice. Yes they will. Stop it.


**On Brewing**

One teabag per person and one for the pot. Do not deviate from this method. You do not know better.
Again taste varies for the strength of your tea. 
It is vital,
VITAL
that you do not over brew the tea. Some of the naturally stronger teas like Yorkshire should not be brewed for long as they will become bitter.

* Don't go and have a piss.
* Don't go and chat up that lovely bird in Finance.
* Don't play Angry Birds.
* STAY. THE. FUCK. THERE.

If you have used a teapot, after a minute use a spoon to stir a few times. Brewing time should be around 4 minutes. Pour a little out into your mug to check the strength. If it is the colour of a dark ale such as [Otter](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vTnoeMChUZ4/TQ46GNA7CkI/AAAAAAAAD04/DkZL5S4NyHw/s1600/Otter+Ale+2010.jpg) then the tea is at a good strength.  
If you have used a mug stirring regularly is fine. A good indicator of when your tea has reached a good strength is that you can only see the top 1/2 inch of the teabag due to the darkness of your beverage.


**On Milk**

People vary in their taste for strong tea. 
While brewing strength is important milk will also lower the strength of your tea. Add it slowly, preferably from a small jug rather than from an ungainly 6 pint milk bottle. You do not want to make a mess, that would be unseemly.
Some people say that you **must** add milk first before adding tea. Some people also believe that pluto isn't a planet. Fuck those people.
I have found that it makes very little difference. Much in the same way that if you were dropped into hot liquid you would scream the same amount as if you had boiling liquid poured onto you.


**On Sugar**

This component is widely debated.
Some will take enough sugar to cause diabetes within a two mile radius.
The great undecided populous will take somewhere between the most infuriating of measures (just a little bit) and what they call 3 teaspoons, which, due to the ever changing laws of science could mean practically any amount.
Those enlightened few will ask for no sugar. This, apart from being a lot easier to measure, is also the most refreshing way to enjoy tea. I have yet to come across anyone who drinks tea with sugar to be anything less than abhorrent.
Of course I say all this in jest. Drink tea as you like it. I would encourage you to try it without sugar for one week. If you remain stoically unaffected then you may return to your faux tea with my faux blessing.

&gt;There is an exception. If someone has just heard some distressing news (like their aunt has just been severely injured by a swan), then sweet tea is the most appropriate prescription.
Also, if you are an OAP, you are allowed to drink tea as sweet as you like with complete impunity.
(Thanks Anon_is_a_Meme)



**On Biscuits**

Digestives or hobnobs.
Rich teas are a sick joke and are a trap for those of you who dunk biscuits in your tea.
If you must have chocolate coated biscuits then choose a dark chocolate variety, these will leave less chocolate on your fingers.


**On Etiquette**

* Tea is a social drink, before you make it enquire as to whether anyone else would like one in the vicinity. 
* Drink at your leisure, coffee is for abusing when deadlines approach
* Biscuits should be served on a side plate
* If you make any mess while making tea clear up after yourself
* It is always best to throw any boiled water and any unused tea away after using the kettle and teapot

I think the best idea would be to:

* [Discover who owns their mortgage](http://www.ehow.com/how_5925106_out-mortgage-specific-property.html).
* Purchase said mortgage.
* Call said mortgage and force them to come up with the cash.
* Repeat if necessary.
* Consider all types of debt, auto loans, lines of credit, etc.

They may not have a mortgage, but I would bet they probably took out one a long time ago and are either paying on it or they have some sort of equity loan for repairs and/or modernizations.

If the mortgage company will not sell it, make sure to publicize exactly who owns the debt and exactly what they are doing to support Westboro.  You could also target the companies providing them with insurance.

Also, I would check to see if there are any types of tax liens, unpaid bills, or default judgements against them and purchase them.  Enforce the contracts and collections to the utmost degree.

Lastly, I would hazard a guess that the executive members and leadership of the church may have some sort of fiduciary responsibility for debts.  If there are any type of judgments against the church you may be able to attempt to collect on them personally.  I would expect that the local municipality will be more than helpful in your quest to recover anything owed.

Okay, here is my attempt at an explanation for why your premise (and therefore conclusion) is basically flawed.  If you care, I have a BS in Finance, and I am currently in my second semester of an MS Finance program.  At this level, finance is at least 75% statistics and calculus.

[Hypergeometric distribution information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution)

**Problem 1 - Nonrandom Variables**  First of all, note that for the hypergeometric distribution to be applicable, the value of the variables must be random.  In the red/blue ball example, the variables are truly random:  we are equally likely to pull a red as a blue, and the chance of pulling a red ball does not influence what the next ball will be.  This is a stark contrast to this voting data.  The most obvious reason why the votes are not random is that *we know in advance* that certain candidates are going to receive the majority of votes.  If Romney won 35%, Santorum won 35%, and Gingrich and Paul each got 15%, then we know the probability of a vote going to a certain candidate, and it is not random.  

Further, I would argue that when a particular vote goes to a candidate, that candidate is more likely to receive the next vote.  Consider that Paul campaigns almost exclusively in certain districts where he has the best chances of winning (districts that often include college campuses).  In these areas, we expect him to perform much better than average, and in areas where he has not campaigned we would expect him to do more poorly.  Once again, the variables are not random, *so a hypergeometric function cannot be used*.  

**Problem 2 - There is a simple, logical explanation for the data**  This is actually related to the first problem, because the heart of the issue still that *the variables are not random and so a hypergeometric function cannot be used*  The explanation is this - you chose to organize your data roughly from least-to-most urban, and Romney tends to perform better in more urban areas.  This explains why he always ""benefits"" in the largest districts.

Please also note that these issues are why Ron Paul seems to be the ""victim"" of ""fraud"".  Your model is assuming that the votes are random, and that each candidate should receive an even % of the vote.  However, we know in advance (from polling) that Romney will win about 35% of the vote and Paul will win about 15% (or whatever, please stay with me here).  So it should not surprise us that the model gives Romney a very remote chance of getting to 35% because the model thinks that, if the election were conducted 100 times, he would receive an average of 25%.  This flawed model also overestimates Paul's chances of performing well, because it thinks he deserves an equal share of a random vote, instead of a smaller share of a nonrandom vote.

**TL;DR**  **The variables (votes) are not random, and so a Hypergeometric function cannot be used to analyze the data.  The premise is flawed, so the conclusion is useless.**

Also, think for a moment what you are suggesting - huge election fraud that has been going on for years.  This data has been analyzed and analyzed again from Berkeley to MIT to Cambridge - if there was fraud that statistical analysis could reveal, then some academic would have published a paper years ago.

edit:  Several people have pointed out that the Hypergeometric model could be tailored to fit data where each data point has a known percent of the total data.  (That is, 70 blue balls and 30 red balls, instead of 50/50.)  Simply put, you guys are right, but I believe that this model was clearly set up for even probabilities.  However, even if that problem were resolved, the votes are still not independent of each other, so the model cannot be used.  I look forward to Drunken_Economist's write up."
15,2012-02-04 12:11:24,"Sheriff Mack, I am in your district -

Your stance on the [issues](http://sheriffmackforcongress.com/issues/) seem very light on the details, seemingly designed to get the most votes from your conservative public body without creating controversy. While I think that your stance on internet freedom mirrors mine, I think it would be unfortunate if that's the only reason you have for me to vote for you.

1- Your district is comprised of many technology companies - several heavy hitters have offices in or nearby (including Dell, Rackspace, Microsoft, and Google). You have apparently discovered Reddit on your own which gives me hope that you actually know more about the internet than your rival; but technology moves fast - what will you do to keep abreast of technology and not *accidentally* support a bill that ends up doing more damage than SOPA/PIPA? Have you thought about contacting some of these companies and requesting to do an ""Employee Open House"" at their office (specifically Rackspace would probably be open to it considering their CEO Lanhan Napier went to Washington to speak to Smith about opposing SOPA and a large percentage of their workforce is most likely in your district).

2 - You are pro-life and against funding "" for so-called family planning groups that promote abortion"" - but you also believe that ""the federal government cannot compel a regulatory scheme which forces citizens to purchase health insurance,"" how would you approach making health care affordable again in the United States?

3 - Do you support term limits for Congress?

4 - Would you vote to amend the Constitution to end corporate personhood in regards to both corporate personhood rights as well as for campaign finance reform?

5 - Would you support the teaching of Creationism in public schools in Texas?

6 - How (or Will) you support future redistricting plans in Texas in order to end [obvious gerrymandering](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Texas.21st.Congressional.District.gif) such as District 21?

**Edit - Adding reply from Sheriff Richard Mack** [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pap79/i_am_sheriff_richard_mack_im_challenging_sopa_and/c3nzi13)


&gt;Thanks so much for the excellent questions. I look forward to being your Congressman.

&gt;1. I already took a tour with one of the heads of Rackspace and I very much appreciated it. It made me even more concerned about what's going with this type of censorship. I still can't believe that Lamar Smith is holding strong on this ridiculous legislation that is going harm people in our district. Also, you don't have to worry about me accidentally supporting legislation that's going to give more power to Washington DC. 

&gt;2. Get government out of the way. One of the greatest expenses for the medical industry in America is malpractice insurance and litigation. If we address tort reform, that would help reduce costs immensely. We do not need the federal government attempting to regulate the healthcare industry. I will never support the Federal government forcing citizens to buy a private health insurance product determined by the federal government.

&gt;3. If it was good enough for George Washington, it should be good enough for Lamar Smith: 8 years.

&gt;4. The Constitution is designed to protect individual freedom. I would support a law that limits what corporations can contribute to campaigns, as well has harsher penalties for those who violate that law, but I would not support an amendment on that issue.

&gt;5. That is certainly not a Federal issue nor a major issue for me. If the local school boards want to make that kind of curriculum available, that's fine with me.

&gt;6. As a Congressman, I don't know how much involvement I would have in Texas redistricting, but I certainly don't like it being used as a political toy. I hope they get this redistricting problem in Texas taken care of soon so that we can get back to work.

**Voting in the Primaries (Primary Process)**

Currently Republican primaries are set for April 3rd, but that [may be delayed due to litigation](http://www.news-journal.com/panola/news/texas-primary-election-schedule-nowhere-in-sight/article_eb3895d1-6ec6-541e-b8a6-bd778f329fb3.html). Check with your [Registrar](http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/county.shtml) for the most up to date information.

&gt;Primary Process: [Quoted source](http://www.texasgop.org/about-the-party)

&gt;Political parties hold a primary election in March of even numbered years. Currently, only two parties hold primaries - the Republican Party and the Democrat Party.

&gt;In Texas, registered voters may vote in either political party’s primary; however, a voter may vote in only one party’s primary in each election cycle.

&gt;If a voter votes in one party’s primary, he may not vote in the other party's run-off election in that same year. Registered voters who do not vote in the primary election may vote in a run-off election of either party that year.

&gt;Republican Primary voters elect the Republican candidates who will appear on the general election ballot, their precinct chairmen, and their county chairmen. Thus, primary voters have a greater influence on the final outcome of the general election than those who only vote in the general election.

&gt;Those who vote in the Republican primary election (either in person or by mail) can then attend the various Republican Party conventions held that year."

20,2012-03-03 22:54:34,"Throwaway account, I work for Carbonite.

As an employee, it's very hard to bear witness to the material effects of something like this.  Our receptionist had to handle over 100 phone calls, and the customer support group was berated and belittled by people - non customers - who called in to complain about the incident.  Many others called in in a civil way to voice their disapproval, but it was generally a rough day for the entire company, as I'm sure any outsider could surmise from our Facebook page.

I'm very glad our CEO did what he did.

There was understandably a lot of chatter on the inside of the company about this.  A lot of people (customers and not) on the social channels were guessing that no women at all worked for Carbonite and that we (the company) are a group of misogynist pigs, which is actually quite the contrary.  

Carbonite is a vastly, vastly female-dominated company.  In fact, the engineering and customer support groups are the only male-dominated areas.  Legal is all female.  Marketing is largely female.  The finance department (except the director) is all female.  The entire HR department is female.

Rush Limbaugh was a worthwhile investment for a budding company looking for a cheap way to get advertising time, but those days are long gone.  Back when, it made sense for us to advertise with Rush Limbaugh; his largely older clientele were very profitable for us, because (despite paying the same flat fee as all of our other customers) they don't have a lot of data.  The number of complaints we got about advertising with Rush was about equal to the number of complaints we got about advertising with some of the lefties, or on some of the shock jock shows on Sirius XM.

As for the personal visit to Rush Limbaugh by our CEO, I don't know if that's actually happened yet.  I do know that, as a public company, this kind of event can make our (largely institutional) investors nervous, which gets things into high gear pretty quickly around the office, and this was certainly beyond the tipping point of attention-getting for us. 

At this point, Rush Limbaugh is going to have a hell of a time looking for advertisers to pay him to regurgitate his offensive spew.

Carbonite is actually a good product, and a lot of people work hard to make it what it is.  I hope our reputation as such isn't permanently tarnished by this massive shitstorm.

edit: no, I am not in the PR department."
21,2012-09-19 10:54:16,"I work in m&amp;a and finance law with experience representing PE firms and banks (among the most vicious of ""fuck-whistleblowers-over"" industries), and have come across stories like this during the course of our due diligence review of target companies' outstanding liabilities.

Much of the advice on this thread is silly. HR is not your friend, and in-house counsel to the company is certainly not your friend. Lawyers act EXCLUSIVELY in the interests of their clients and unless their clients are committing some wrong during the course of pending litigation (lying during a deposition, submitting false evidence, intimidating witnesses, etc.) they are ethically obligated not to say ANYTHING that is adverse to their clients' interests. Do not approach either HR or in-house legal. 

If you have documentation as to whether or not illegal activity has been going on, you need to collect it and save it in some capacity at a place that the company or its representatives cannot access it. Create an electronic copy if you can, as this makes seizure in the probable forthcoming litigation much more difficult. Chances are, you have signed a non-disclosure agreement or some kind of contract that prevents you from disclosing company secrets. You should take these steps immediately, and worry about the NDA later. If you are concerned that even removing physical pieces of paper from the premises violates your NDA, proceed to step two below. However, it is important to note that privacy shield and the principle of non-disclosure are easily pierced when the breacher has a good faith belief that illegal activity is ongoing and the documents were removed in the process of securing this claim.

Step two is to find yourself a lawyer, and preferably someone with experience in this field. Do not just open the yellow pages and call someone up; you need to specifically look for lawyers who have represented whistleblowers before. Specifically, you need to consult with them as to what exactly your liability is here. Relevant considerations:

1. Are you exposed to criminal liability for not exposing this sooner despite knowing that it is ongoing? Chances are, you are not. But you need to discuss this with someone who is shielded from discussing this in a public forum i.e. your lawyer.

2. How do whistleblower laws in your jurisdiction impact your financial liability? If there are not sufficient protections in place for whistleblowers in your jurisdiction, making a hasty decision in the public eye may adversely impact your employment status (e.g. you are demoted, transferred to a different office, fired for non-relevant reasons, etc.)

3. Are the claims that you are making based on the evidence you have collected or observed adding up? It is very possible that you are overstating the nature of the illegal activity here. I cannot imagine that it is actually legal, but the possibility is just one more reason that you should consult a lawyer about this. I can't comment without you providing specifics, and I would advise against providing those in a public forum like Reddit.

4. How do whistleblower laws in your jurisdiction impact your long-term financial liability? Chances are, if the funds are not returned with interest, the company will seek to depose you in the course of a civil suit to ensure that *a)* you have not yourself contributed to or attempted to benefit from the embezzlement of company funds and *b)* the evidence and testimony that they gain from discovery will ensure a swift and sizeable settlement. **This is very key.**

Even if you choose not to testify in the course of a criminal trial, you may still be forced to testify for the purpose of civil litigation. Chances are, going down this road will require that you either tell the truth on the stand and put your statements in the public record, or lie. I can't advise that you do the latter, but it sounds like you don't have much problem with the former anyway. However, IF you are able to contribute to the successful prosecution of your boss without exposing yourself or while remaining anonymous, I highly suggest that you take that route. Whistleblowers tend not to receive the most leniency within their respective industries, and simultaneously conducting a job search while wrapped up in these kinds of proceedings will get messy very quickly. Any further steps you take should be taken in consultation with your attorney, who will be able to guide you through the specific laws of your jurisdiction.

**TL;DR - Make sure you can prove you're not full of shit, then lawyer up and stop asking neckbeards for advice**


Lastly, I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to NOT decide to go ""the cheaper route"" with options like NOLO or LegalZoom out there. These are generally good resources for people just trying to start their own company, or who have small claims, etc. Your claim is far more serious than that and may expose you to serious legal and financial liability. It may seem extravagant now, but what you pay now will save you much headache and heartache down the road. Best of luck.


EDIT: If you need help contacting a lawyer or locating a quality lawyer, there are many resources available and I am happy to assist. None of the above is intended to qualify as legal advice."

27,2012-07-22 15:04:48,"**When In Doubt, Always Answer Space**

I have a friend who is always successful in job interviews. One day we're talking about interviews and resumes and whatnot, and I ask him what his secret to success is.

The key, he says, is the ""where do you see yourself in 10 years"" question. When posed this question, he will take a minute, flash a pensive look towards the sky, then lock eyes with the interviewer. ""Space.""

I ask, Space? What the fuck, don't you work in finance?

As he extrapolates on this answer, I realize how perfect this response really is. It gives him a chance to talk about human advancement, and how the world we live in is becoming crazier and more amazing every day. It allows him to boast about his desire for worldliness, and doing things that push the envelope. He can also talk about his optimism and his belief that even seemingly unrealistic goals are always able to be attained if you have a vision for the future.

Most importantly--the answer is *really fucking funny.* It ensures that the interviewer will be thinking about him all day, even telling their friends about the out-of-the-blue (out-of-this-world?) interview answer they heard today.

He's gotten every job that he's interviewed for after giving this answer.

Yeah boo I know, but her main thing quickly became the much cooler job of fixing loans for soldiers going overseas ect so that their paperwork was right and their car didn't get pick up.  She got that promotion after finding a car...with two missing kids in it that the FBI had been looking for.  

The FBI came in and looked at her paperwork and they congratulated her.  She had basically tracked the owner of this vehicle across the country using all their usual tricks.  You'd be amazed what these people can find and what they are authorized to observe.  Apparently it's more then the FBI can see or they would have found them.  Following his credit report she saw there was a check on his report done by an apartment complex.  The guy had an oil change done at a near by jiffy lube and the vin # was reported the same day.  They had a repo agent at the apartment complex on a regular pick up later that day.  The agent called into her advising he found the vehicle but the owner was violently resisting the repo so they had to get local authorities involved.  The local police did a check on the guy and he was wanted by the feds for kidnapping.  He and his baby's mama broke up so he took his kid and hers to which he was no relation and just left town.  His kid won't leave peacefully unless the other went so he grabbed them both and took off.  They were back home the same day my wife authorized the pick up.  

Her boss tried to take the credit but her name was all over it."
30,2012-10-11 05:01:35,"I tried to keep this short, but it just didn't work.

""Totally unacceptable"" was a term that was used on me when I took over as lead maintenance technician at very small punch press outfit.  My boss, the maintenance engineer warned me the first day that there were a bunch of idiots working here, that we needed to keep an eye on them.  He was really old-school, but he definitely knew his stuff.

The design engineer and the process engineer came over because they needed a part punched. They wanted to punch a single part in a press that normally punched four parts simultaneously. The machine usually used a 4'x8' sheet of material. The die head was one piece, but it punched four parts, so it had four dies in it.

They didn't want to use new material, so their grand idea was to use a piece of scrap and punch a single part. Like kind of just visually align it under one of the four dies and press just one single part on a piece of material just big enough to do the job.

I told them they couldn't do that, it would break the press due to the inequality in pressure, they needed to use a full piece. They gave me the ""We're engineers, lowly lead technician go away"" talk and the ""we need to understand the process better"" talk. So I started walking (quickly) over to my bosses office, to tell them what they were planning.

I got into his office and said ""&lt;Name&gt; and &lt;Name&gt; are trying to run a single part on the big press and.....""  before I finished the sentence there was a deafening ""CRACRACK!"" that filled the plant.

They broke two of the four main hydraulic cylinders.  My boss and I ran over to the big press.  Hydraulic oil pretty much everywhere, and the two engineers still trying to operate the press.  The die was all the way down, they were cranking on the ""up"" button, trying to get two cylinders to do the job of four.  Hydraulic oil was still flowing to the two broken cylinders and just *pouring* out of them.

My boss flipped his shit.  He called them every name in the book and shut the power off to the machine.  

Cue the management/engineering meeting I got dragged into. I was in charge of part stock, which was ultimately nothing because management commonly shot down maintenance ordering ""unneeded parts"".  Our purchase orders never got approved.

The two main cylinders that broke were proprietary parts. You couldn't order them anywhere but from the manufacturer.  When I was asked how many we have in stock i said ""Zero, they only break if you run the press in an improper manner.""

The owner of the company screamed ""Zero! That's totally unacceptable!"" and then my boss opened up the flood gates, everything from my purchase orders repeatedly getting denied to ""The two morons trying to run something when they were specifically told not to!""

This is the part where I giggle uncontrollably every time I think about it.

The owner of the company I worked for demanded we get the press company on the phone, on a conference call.  I told them I would have to go get my contact information.  I called my contact while I was in the maintenance office to let him know the conference call was coming and what happened. So he wasn't caught off guard.  I had only talked to him a few times about technical information in the past, never ordering anything.  Just giving him a heads up about the shit that was about to be dumped in his lap.  It was short and to the point.

We get him on the phone in the conference room. The guy tells them there is a two week waiting period for *refurbished* cylinders and a *new cylinder* can take up to a month.  You could hear the keyboard clicking on his end of the line.  All of the sudden you hear ""Hold on I have to transfer you.""

Every working part of the company was in this room on the conference call. We had everything from me as a lead technician to the finance manager in this meeting.  Everyone was represented. Production Engineer, obviously the Design and Process, there was about 15 people in on this conference call.

The contact at the press company had transferred us to billing and collections.  The company I worked for put a down payment on this press and then financed the rest through the press company. Outside of the down payment, they hadn't paid a single payment on the press in quite some time.....like a year.  I am not sure how they still even had it.  When my contact went to put in order information, it got red-flagged and policy was to immediately transfer the call to collections.

You could hear a pin drop in the conference room.  Then you just hear my boss mumble just loud enough for everyone to hear ""Well *that's* just totally unacceptable"".  I had to walk out of the conference room because I almost burst into laughter.

The owner then decided to argue with the finance guy on the phone, he got transferred to the highest part of the finance department.  The owner was highly religious. He was telling this guy things like ""God would want them to send us the parts"" and ""It would be extremely God-like"" if they could send us the part to keep our ""humble little plant"" in business.  Just going on and on.

More deafening silence.  Then you just hear the finance guy from the press company say ""God may deliver your parts, we're not going to until this financial matter is resolved."" and just more silence.  

At this point I had a *huge* chunk of my cheek between my teeth and biting down, trying my damnedest not to laugh.  Thankfully the owner flipped his shit and kicked us all out of the conference room so he could continue the call privately.  My boss and I went back to his office and laughed for about half an hour, then became depressed because it was a bad sign for the company.

I am not sure how, but about a month later, two refurbished cylinders showed up.  Their main machine sat idle for a month waiting for parts.  I never asked if they caught up on payments or if some other set up was made.

Shortly after my boss quit and I got his job and then shortly after that I quit because of another incident.  The company ended up going belly up for multiple reasons.  One of the biggest I would assume is that the owner was just siphoning money out of the company and not paying off debt.

31,2012-11-17 13:45:14,"Hi. I did exactly what you've said, so I thought I'd share my story. 

I had a pretty good job in finance. I wasn't exactly a top-paid banker, but I was doing pretty well. It was secure (debt management, so pretty recession-proof) and challenging enough to be enjoyable. The people were cool, and the prospects were very promising. There was little reason to go do anything else. However, I also enjoy occasionally acting, so I did bits and bobs with the local amateur dramatics group. Nothing too big, but enough to quench the acting bug. 

Then I heard of an audition call for Little Shop Of Horrors. 

It was an amateur production, but it was big. This group would throw tens of thousands at a show, and I knew their regulars were top notch. I ummed and ahhed about auditioning for a while. It was a show I love, but it was very high-brow and the standard was amazingly high. I nearly didn't go, but I went ""fuck it"" at the last minute and went. 

As I thought, the others were amazing. I would gladly pay to hear each and every one perform, but I gave it my best shot. I sung my little heart out, and got a call-back, much to my surprise. Went to the callback with the cream of the crop, and put my all in. After a few exhausting hours, I went home to wait for the outcome. 

Then, two days later, the Director rang. I was Seymour!

Words cannot describe how excited I was. It was bliss! The rehearsals went on for four months, and was beyond exhausting. I worked harder than I ever worked, even at work. In fact, work became that thing I did to pay my way through the acting. It became more and more back-seat. 

For the show run, I booked it all off and ""lived the life"" of an actor. I slept in, pottered around the house, went to the theatre in the afternoon for vocal warm-up, put on a show, then went out for drinks afterwards. Rinse and repeat. I don't think I can summon the words to describe how beautiful that time in my life was. It was just beautiful. 

Then the show ended. The audience clapped, and it was over. I went to work on Monday, sat down..... And I almost cried. I just couldn't do it anymore. I'd tasted too much of heaven, and I couldn't go back to my cell. I had to do it. 

I quit. I left my secure job and salary, sold my car, and went to study acting. I just couldn't go back to my old life; I was going to become an actor. 

I graduated in July this year. Tomorrow (Sunday 18th Nov) I start rehearsals for my first professional tour around Birmingham, UK. 

It's hard. It's not secure. It's testing. But my god, I couldn't do anything else, and wouldn't change it for all the job security or company cars in the world. 

**TL;DR** worked desk job. Then, suddenly Seymour. Now professional actor. 

Edit: ANSI to And. "

35,2012-12-29 13:41:52,"It's Google's search algorithm that matches Apple with the term sell, not an easter egg.

Look at Apple's description on Google Finance:

(Apple) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and ***sell***s a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company's products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and OS X operating systems, iCloud, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also ***sell***s and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App StoreSM, iBookstoreSM, and Mac App Store.

In February 2012, the Company acquired app-search engine Chomp.


It has 3 instances of the word sell, which I'm assuming because of how massive Apple, Inc. is, that it is enough for Google to think that when you search for the word sell, you are really looking for Apple.

Yes, it's a funny coincidence. But it has nothing to do with Google.

Edit: It's actually 4 uses of the word 'sell', if you count 'resellers'.

36,2012-07-07 12:17:18,"OP, as others have said consult a professional for advice. Is anyone handling your mother's estate? Does she have a will? Also, do you have any older, trustworthy family members who can help you?

That said, I'm a CPA (not personal finance-related, however). Here's what I would do, if this happened to me and I were in your same shoes. **if any personal finance/investment redditors want to add anything, please do**:

Think of your $90K (and, later on, your siblings') in terms of spending/savings/investment layers:

* First (revised thanks to Canada2 below), have money ready to cover any immediate expenses that arise. However, from Canada 2 below:
&gt;If your mothers estate has more debt than assets then her creditors eat the loss. They cannot come after you. Do not spend a single penny of your own money dealing with her estate unless you know that you can get money out of it.

* Second, assess outstanding bills for your household that mother was taking care of--utilities, cable, HoA fees, property taxes...someone's going to have to cover these at least until you decide to get rid of some services. 

* [removed section about inherting your mother's debt as Canada2 pointed out below] If debt collectors call, ignore them.

* (Side note): You should try to get a clear a picture of what your mother's financial situation was--all her assets and debt. Also, does she have any benefits owed to her, such as from work or from life insurance policy? Unpaid wages from work? 

* Fourth, you will need to take care of recurring expenses-- Bills, food, school fees, clothes...all the little things to take care of yourself and your younger siblings. You are going to be in charge now. Create a reasonable budget for spending each month or week, even. Hopefully your siblings' $90k trusts will allow them to draw on their money for such expenses.  **The key is to maintain a stable system of home and financial maintenance.** 

Now, our head is above water, so to speak. Let's consider savings and investments:

* Fifth, pay down any debt you have. Hopefully you don't have much or any as an 18-year-old. 

* Fifth (part 2): credit cards can be useful to build your credit score. Get a credit card that you *pay off monthly*. That's key. Don't get a credit card and then use it to buy a stereo.

* sixth, allocate money to an emergency savings account, something more than just a rainy day fund. It should be enough money that you and your siblings could survive off of for at least six months (a year preferably) without *any* source of income. You should have relatively easy access to this fund, so I *think* it should go into a regular savings account (although a personal finance planner may argue differently). It should only be used in emergencies. 

* seventh, allocate money to a mid-term savings account (3-5 years), something that is safe and expected to match or beat inflation that will be spent on stuff like college tuition and fees for your siblings and other non-emergency large purchases. Once your siblings turn 18 and leading up to then, give them advice on managing their money. At that point, the emotional and financial burden on you will be somewhat lifted as they will be more independent.

* eighth, now you have more discretion with investing your money. Consider focusing on long-term investments (20+ years). It's never too early to plan for retirement and starting your own family. I'm not knowledgeable enough to tell you *what* to invest in, so you need to read up on it and get professional advice later, however, it's safer to make riskier investments while you're young (you have more time to recoup losses than an elderly person). Just don't invest more than you're willing to lose. There are many options out there: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, IRAs, etc... Usually it's good to have a mix. A 401k with your employer is good, especially if they match your contributions. But don't let it be your main retirement vehicle. In the end, it all depends on what your financial goals are. Consult an investment professional.

Some final words...you are still a kid. Yes you will have to ""man up"" in terms of responsibility, but you are still a kid who might lose his mother. You're allowed to cry and to seek help from others. 

Don't let anyone push you around. If you don't understand something during this whole process, keep asking questions. Don't depend and wait on people to come to you and tell you what you need to do. See the entire process till the end. Then get ready for a new beginning. Your siblings need you more than ever now. *hug*"
37,2012-09-17 12:49:37,"Alright, so here's what I'll say.

Genna is actively looking into creating a small team in Korea. There are circumstances arising that would allow this to happen. We are looking to finance player salaries, accomodation and travel expenses with the help of sponsors. I will create content surrounding the team and give ROI to the sponsors using my Youtube audience, an advantage which no other team has and may make it possible for this to actually be feasible. 

This is for the most part her project and we still don't know if it's viable since we'd need sponsor interest to really sustain it. Running a team is a hefty drain on finances and we'd be looking into creating something self-sustaining, since we clearly wouldn't be making back what we put in.

So yeah, you might seem Team Cynical at some point. I'm coming up with ideas that take advantage of our unique position and give us an edge over other teams when it comes to finding sponsors and Genna is doing all the hard work :P

The title is misleading because it implies that we have tried to get sponsors and failed. We have only just begun this process and if we CAN get sponsors, this will happen."

45,2012-02-02 12:23:34,"Say you're a merchant living in 17th century Amsterdam, and there's a bunch of super-rich ladies who really, really loves cumin (as in, the spice). Unfortunately, cumin doesn't grow anywhere near Amsterdam, you have to go to the middle east or India to get some of that fine stuff so it's *super-expensive*. Over there, however, it grows like a weed and costs very little money. If only you could get some of that cheap cumin over to Amsterdam, you could make a lot of money!

Unfortunately, the only way to do that is to send out a big-ass ship for like nine months. Not only is that HUGELY expensive (you have to get a ship, and a captain and crew who all wants nine months worth of pay), but it is also really risky. The boat could sink, after all, or all the cumin could spoil. 

So how do you accomplish this? Assuming you're not stupendously rich yourself (and very few people or groups, aside from maybe whole nations, are that rich), how do you finance this? You could go to a bank or money-lender and take out a loan, a loan which would have a very steep interest rate that could almost eat up all of your profits. And what if the boat sank? You'd be completely bankrupt, and be thrown into prison, if the money-lender doesn't waste your broke ass first. 

So, you come up with an idea. You can't finance this trip alone. But you could rather easily finance, say, one tenth of the cost of the trip. And look at that, you have nine friends, all of whom could also afford one tenth of the cost of the trip. So you all come to an agreement: you decide to each finance part of the cost for the trip (i.e. you ""buy stock"" in the enterprise), each getting shares worth one tenth of the total enterprise. With this money, you pay for the boat and crew, send them off, and then nine months later, it comes back with a cargo-hold full of delicious, super-expensive cumin. The profits far and away compensate for the initial cost, and each of you and your friends gets one tenth of the enormous profits.

But what happens if your boat sinks? Well, it's a real bummer obviously (especially for the crew!), but you only payed for one tenth of the cost, and this was a cost you could afford to eat, you're not gonna get killed over it. Since the risk was spread around to 10 people, no one landed in debtors prison. Everyone took a small hit, instead of one person taking an enormous hit. 

Think about this example, and all the people involved in it. The fancy ladies got their cumin (and for cheaper than they would have otherwise). The shipwrights got work building a new ship. The captain and crew all got work and a salary. The trader in India got a new customer for his cumin. And obviously, you and your friends got really rich in the process. In short, *every single person is better off*, and it wouldn't have happened if this notion of ""buying and selling stocks"" didn't exist. 

This is the advantage of a stock market. It moves capital around from where it just lies around doing absolutely nothing to where it can be put to use, and in the meantime, everybody gets richer. It also distributes risk between lots of people, so you don't have to be afraid of going broke all the time. 

Now, obviously, there are problems with how the modern day American version of the stock market functions. But the critique is that it stopped doing what doing what it is supposed to be doing (i.e. allocating capital so that it can be put into productive use) and stopped being a means to an end, and it became an end unto itself. The basic concept of a stock market is a fantastic idea, and you'd have to be a real hard-core communist to oppose it. It is why we have railroads, cars, computers, telephones, cheap and plentiful food, medicine, and all the other modern things we value so highly. "

1. Defense budget cuts. Could America significantly reduce it's military spending and stay a world leader? How much could be cut?

2. Campaign finance reform. Is the Supreme court wrong to allow corporations unlimited contributions to campaigns? What can we do to keep these races fair for the American voter?

3. What does he expect from Obama's 2nd term? Broader health care reform? Tax reform?

4. States legalizing marijuana despite federal laws. What does he see on the horizon regarding this issue? Will the federal government amend it's position if enough states legalize it? 

5. What is the biggest threat to America's future at the moment? Foreign powers? Environment? Unemployment/economy?

48,2012-02-17 12:04:44,"Ok, quick refresher course from the folks over at /r/AskHistorians since we're all talking about the Cold War and Nuclear Deterrence.

During the Cold War we talked about the ""three Cs"" of Deterrence:

1. Capability -- I can't help but notice that I have a lot of nuclear weapons
2. Communication -- ""Hey, Jackhole!  I have a lot of nuclear weapons. If you so much as twitch in the direction of that launch button I'm going to drastically increase the availability of parking in your major metropolitan areas""
3. Credibility -- ""Crap man, I think he'll really do it.  That motherfracker is CA-RAZY.""  

The whole idea behind the Cold War arms race was to prevent the other guy from using his weapons.  The US wanted to have enough nukes in difficult enough to destroy places that, even if the Soviets flipped out and decided that they needed beach-front property in [Calais](http://g.co/maps/z5dsp), enough of our weapons would survive their first strike that we could turn Moscow and a few other cities into smoking abrasions in the Earth's crust.

The theory was that, what with the Soviets liking the temperatures in Moscow, Leningrad, Vladivostok, etc at roundabouts the same traditional order of magnitude they'd avoid doing anything rash.

Likewise the USSR was concerned that the Americans would get it into their heads that the easiest way to keep from having to revise all of the maps that depicted the East Coast with cities on it would be to just eliminate the Soviet nuclear weapons stockpile in a direct and straightforward manner, so they did much the same thing.  

Both sides had basically three tiers of targets, depending on who launched first.  

Tier 1 (I'm launching first): Bomber bases, ICBM silos, early warning radar emplacements: anything that could facilitate the delivery of a couple of kilotons of unwanted radioactive lovin' to a distant part of the globe.  We call these ""counter force targets"" and they're what you hit if you to make your enemy less dangerous.

Tier 2 (hey!  you launched on me): Cities, towns, centers of government, and finance.  These are the targets that you hit -- or more accurately that you threaten to hit -- if you want your enemy to think twice about attacking you.  These are called ""counter value"" targets and the idea here to ensure such terrible retribution as to make the cost of an attack prohibitively high.  

Tier 3 (from hell's heart I strike at thee!): Munitions factories, power stations, enrichment plants.  These are targets for the long haul and are chosen to reduce the enemy's capability to make war over the course of YEARS.  If Tier 3 targets are being hit it's time to start stockpiling bottle caps and learning to identify Rad Scorpions at range because we've just graduated from a potentially limited nuclear exchange to all out World War Three mode.

Obama's reduction in weapons stockpiles recognizes that there's really no one in the world who can find and sink our submarine fleet and that means that we don't need giant stockpiles of weapons to maintain the Credibility (third C) of our nuclear deterrent.   Even if China or Russia or... I guess North Korea... decides to start something, it's only a matter of time before one of the fourteen US nuclear ballistic missile submarines uses its 144+ nuclear warheads to necessitate some new census figures.  The inability of anyone to **find** those boats makes much of the land and air based US missile force unnecessary.

Dear (name of state) Legislator

Legalization has the ability to perform several beneficial actions: first it saves (name of state) money from prosecuting simple misdemeanor marijuana possession, second it dries up a large revenue base of inner city drug dealers as illegal marijuana has one of the highest profit margins of any street drug, third it gives control and regulation authority to the government who would have the ability to prohibit sale to minors, and last but not least, it provides the opportunity for substantial tax revenue which can be used to finance prevention and rehabilitation programs.

Hemp, an industrial marijuana plant which cannot get you 'high', will produce clean fuel; both bio-diesel and ethanol. It will provide a source of building materials that reduce deforestation. When mixed with lime, it produces a superior concrete-like material that is stronger, lighter, more flexible and self-insulating. It’s a source of food for human or animal, paper, paint…even biodegradable plastic! It has been a staple industrial crop in the United States since the founding of our nation until it was banned alongside marijuana in the 1930's.

Personal use of Marijuana is, as former DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis Young has said after exhaustive research, “…Safer than many of the foods we commonly consume.” Study after study shows there is no such thing as a “Gateway” substance. In fact, the 1999 Institute of Medicine comprehensive study blew away most of the myths that have kept Marijuana illegal.

Cannabis’s efficacy as a medicine is well-proven. Humans have what’s known as the Endocannabinoid system; receptors throughout the body that react only to cannabinoids, such as those present in marijuana, which play a role in the physiological modulation of many central and peripheral functions. Because it is oil soluble, it can travel through the body and has been shown to attack tumors and cancer cells. It also treats deep pain, which can help replace addictive opiate drugs; as well as provide benefit to those suffering from nuerodegenerative diseases such as ALS, MS, and Alzheimer's disease. All with no objectionable side effects other than the slight loss in motor coordination which marijuana users have called 'being high'.

Would you deny a better economy and better lives to citizens of (name of state)?

Yours truly,

(your name)

50,2012-09-21 18:17:21,"So my fiancé and I have been planning on getting engaged for a couple of months at this pont. In fact, she even helped me pick out a ring knowing that I would be terrible at it (honestly, the one I had selected at first and did a bunch of research on was laughed at by many of my coworkers that I showed, so probably for the best). After having it fitted, I picked it up and decided to take my time and try to do something romantic and memorable for our engagement. One night, about a week after i picked it up, while drinking with my folks, my finance stumbled across the ring. She put it on and I didn't even notice. It started as kind of as a joke to see if anyone noticed. She went to go show my mother, who was at this point was fairly tipsy, and she started to freak out crying and saying ""oh my God I'm so happy for you two"". I walk into the room and my father poured me a shot and said congratulations. Before you I even knew what was going on, my on her death bed great grandmother was already being called to get the good news. I pulled her aside, and my fiancée just says "" I just wanted to show your mom how pretty it was"". I took it off, got down on one knee and proposed to her on my deck in the back yard.


I was engaged and wasn't even aware of it!"
51,2012-01-07 15:13:54,"Enough with the circlejerk over SOPA.  

* First, nobody would care if reddit went down and it would be completely insignificant compared to google or facebook.  


* Second, none of those other sites are actually going to 'go dark'.  This stupid rumor has been reposted ad nauseam around the internet enough already.  It's not happening.  Stop talking about it like it is.  


* Third, none of the other efforts so far have made so much as a dent in SOPA.  The GoDaddy bullshit just proved that reddit has zero pull in affecting the real world.  You guys spammed the major subreddits for weeks talking about it only to get a wishy-washy PR statement from GoDaddy and a net increase in domain transfers TO GoDaddy (probably from all the free advertising).  Stop congratulating yourselves for saving the world (again) just because some tech blog mentioned reddit.


* Fourth, even if you did get ALL the original supporters to recant and say they publicly oppose it, it doesn't matter anymore.  It's in Congress's hands now that the representatives have already been lobbied with campaign donations.

This is a symptom of a much larger problem- namely that special interests with lots of money can buy their own laws.  The entertainment industry, financial industry, autoworkers unions, teachers unions, agribusiness, pharama... they all have access far and above what the general public has in D.C.  A bunch of big name firms on K street have the easiest game in town- they set up invitation-only campaign fundraising events around D.C. where you have to pay to play.  They tell your representatives what action they would like to see, your representative gets some money to out-spend their competition in the next election, and voila.  All of a sudden the 'clean coal' supporters are exempt from EPA regulations, or multinational corporations get a 'one-time' exemption to return foreign profits at 5% taxation instead of 35%, or farmers get a nice subsidy to NOT grow corn, and so on.

These special interests have been solidifying their influence for decades.  Instead of having to compete they simply buy their own rules to make sure they stay on top.  And politicians LOVE IT because it means once they get elected they can ride their incumbency campaigns to victory until some sex scandal becomes too egregious for their own attack ads to undo.  Even if you got google, facebook, twitter, and the whole internet to protest this time all it would do is push SOPA to the public's attention for a few days while Congress passes something else that's ever so slightly watered down under a different name while nobody is paying attention anymore.  You're never going to fix this until you get real campaign finance reform and strict regulation of federal elections.  The system is broken.  Tweaking the inputs a little here and there is not going to fix it."
52,2012-09-25 23:48:14,"My uncle was killed on September 11th. I didn't cry that day. I didn't cry the next day. I tried to stay strong - I tried to be somewhat of a rock while people around me were wavering. But I was in eighth grade, and on the third day I broke. I spent the entire day in tears, most of it hugging my mom. I think about my uncle a lot - he was a good man. His kids - my cousins - were the reason he lived. And although he worked in the hectic field of finance, he was always home for dinner with them. I saw him more than I saw other Uncles I was geographically closer to, just because he made sure to be a part of everyone's lives.

Reading though this brings everything rushing back. I avoided anything to do with September 11th for years, so I had no idea these were ever published. There are people commenting about how these blurbs are poorly done, but at the end of the day it's difficult to summarize thousands of lives when your world is crumbling apart. Let's not forget that these NY times writers were New Yorkers themselves. They were living just like everyone else in those days - they were afraid, they were grieving, and they did not know what was going to happen next.

What I'm trying to say is that, though some of these small obituaries may be flawed, they're an incredible look at what a group of human beings decided to do to honor the fallen and leave no one forgotten.

My uncle was one dead man among thousands. In spite of his insignificance (for lack of a better word), they dedicated three paragraphs to his memory. It may not be much, but this is now one of the only things I have to connect me to the man I remember.

tl;dr - onions."
53,2012-07-17 11:20:01,"&gt;But Republicans turned their backs, including John McCain, once the great champion of campaign finance reform who has been predicting that “huge scandals” will inevitably flow from Citizens United.

Or the John McCain that said that [Adelson's contributions](http://news.yahoo.com/mccain-foreign-cash-sneaking-via-super-pacs-190111419.html) to Romney's super PACs amounted to foreign contributions?

54,2012-02-20 11:04:10,"This, for the love of god this... We honestly need a movement in this country for deep, severe, and fundamental voting, election and campaign financing reform.

----------------

The bottom line is simple. The system is set up for those with money to be able to buy politicians.

This will never change until we enact

1. **Campaign Finance reform** - Public fund only; no private, corporate, personal, or other public funds can be given. Amount determined by scheduled benchmark votes. Final vote always a choice between 5-10 with a maximum of two from each party.

2. **Voting System reform** - [Schulze Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) ([rated choice](https://modernballots.com/)) on open-source software and hardware voting machines and internet voting with [checks and balances built in](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_bismark_e_voting_without_fraud.html) (you can check your vote at any time etc).

3. **[Shortest Splitline](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUS9uvYyn3A) Districts** - We have a completely unbias method for choosing boundaries for congressional districts. We should use it.

4. **Political Party reform** - Schultz Method voting erodes the party system but the proposed system should embrace a diverse political party system.

5. **Mixed-Member proportional** - Now that your political process has had most of its corruption physically removed, you can give them a bone and make the proportion of congress more representative of the actual will of the people.

At this same time another salesperson was selling a brand new Eddie Bauer Explorer to a dad for a present to his daughter. 
As I was presenting the Daewoo to the new owners the daughter of the other dad comes in to see her new Explorer. She starts throwing a shit fit and yells ""I didn't want an explorer, I wanted an Expedition!!!""  
I was really proud of the dad of the Explorer as he walked back into the finance office.  He changed the deal.  He corraborated with the guy buying the daewoo and switched the names...

58,2012-10-16 00:15:40,"I think there's a lot of idea in the basic concept of the show, and the first episode already shows a lot of good things to come. Now, if I understand the concept right, you will be going to different do-good organizations and present them, and drive people to finance it. The glue is you, your personality and taste, and they are the trigger that gets people to watch you. 

Few things I'd like to suggest to improve future episodes:

1. More of you there. Look at Sam Dunn and his metal documentaries, I think he brings the perfect amount of himself to the play; you are interesting,  intelligent, charismatic and well, not bad on the eyes either, so you could be more there, seeing the world and the organizations through your eyes and explanations. 

2. Invest on sound quality. Sound quality is usually one thing that can't be fixed now or later, and is usually the one thing that really divides complete amateur and aspiring professional's work. So, buying a cheap wireless mic for people you interview, and maybe an external mic as well will get you a long way.

3. Bring in drama. As much as I respected the first episode, the problem was the lack of drama there. Present a problem, get people talk about the real problems behind these organizations, this way you get emotions into the play. People are interested in problems, and you could re-format the thought behind the program a bit, in a way that you introduce the organization, and then bring out the problem the organization if facing and get people talking about it, this brings emotions forward, and only then go into sort of ""sales pitch"" of the organization. And again, bring yourself there more than people behind it, they are good people but not maybe as interesting to the camera as you could be."

They say nothing and advise me to get temporary insurance so I can drive the car out of the dealership myself when it arrives (it was coming from another branch). Two days before it was due to arrive, they called saying that they checked it over again and the crankshaft had actually gone, it would need a new engine and they were going to cut their loses and auction it instead.

We called bullshit and I sent them a nicely worded letter referencing a lawyer a couple of times and lo and behold, they 'repaired' the crankshaft and I got my car.

Tried to tell us as we signed the paperwork that they were making a £500 loss on the thing and my dad was just like ""Welcome to the business world."" I had a friend have a look under the bonnet and he confirmed that the engine had never been touched."
66,2012-07-30 06:33:17,"It's just a mentality thing. The Green party is among the 4 big political parties in Germany. People just actually care about the environment. While in the U.S. you just recently started seriously considering buying a Prius, ppl in Texas still laugh their ass off at that decision and drive their ridiculously large and wasteful pickups. At the same time in Germany, people have been demanding fuel efficient cars since the 80's and manufacturers have delivered.  
  
'Murica builds Hummer, Germany builds VW Golf ...

We also have things like an ""environment tax"" on our gasoline. This would never be possible in the U.S., you guys consume too much and consuming LOTS OF SHIT is just so centrally anchored in your culture that you would never, as a whole nation, willingly sacrifice your level of consumption for such wild theories as global warming or the POTENTIAL PROSPECT of something POSSIBLY IMPORTANT such as ""THE ENVIRONMENT"".  

So, this all lead to Germany pushing for a European Law that enables and motivates all European countries to further the advancement and expansion of renewable energies in Europe, the EEG (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz = Renewable Energy Law). Other core member states such as France quickly followed (the Brits never follow, they are opposed to do anything that is not tied to printing money based on imaginary transactions and ""financing"" but they came around eventually).  

So now, somewhere in the 90's, a law was in place that stated ""Every European Country has made it its goal to expand renewable energies, the form in which renewables are furthered are matters of legislation of each particular country"".  

And here is where you see the differences in each nation's thinking. Germany was one of the first countries to subsidize renewable energies, set some of the most ambitious goals ( X% by 2020 etc.) and quickly had the most attractive structure for funding in place from all European countries. Plus we naturally had suitable technologies in place quickly (with companies like Nordex, Enercon, Vestas, etc.).  

France always set ambitious goals, passed legislation on proper feed-in tariffs and then on a local scale allowed ""prefects"" of certain areas to hamper the construction of entire groups of wind farms based on personal reasons. Generally it's a strong up and down in France. One year it is almost as good as Germany, one year you can't build or sell a single project. Every year they set ambitious goals in terms of X% renewables by year X. Usually trying to rival Germany. And each other year they pussy out on a federal level and let their local officials screw an entire industry over based on personal preferences. By that I mean that in France there are still LOADS of people dependant on nuclear power (in terms of JOBS) and the nuclear lobby is much more powerful than in Germany, Fukushima helped, sadly to say...  

The Brits, as usual first said ""NAY! WE SHALT NOT PARTAKE IN THINE STRANGE NEW UNDERTAKINGS. THIS IS FOLLY. BUT WE SHALT OBSERVE YOU AND FRANCE, WHILE WE KEEP OUR POUND AND SEE WHAT SHALL HAPPEN.""  
Few years later the Brits realized: ""Shit, we don't produce anything, our industry is solely based on our overblown Finance industry which is in turn based/build on sand/clouds.... We better take part in this renewable energy shit!"". And so they did, slowly, because they are Brits...  

Ireland is actually an incredible nation for renewable energies, particularly wind power! Guess the Irish really are green! :D And they were in a rather depressive state of their economy when they realized ""Hey, that renewable energy shit might get us out of this pickle!"" and so they did. Shame that the Financing sector (Brits *cough, cough* doesn't want to finance more renewable energy projects in Ireland, due to the fragile state of their economy... Yeah.... FINANCE HAHAHAHA .....  

Then there are countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. I mean windmills, renewable energies, hello? Those are just small countries that always had to be ahead of the curve and not miss out on important new technologies and business ventures such as renewable energies to stay as relevant as they are today. The Netherlands and Denmark are actually relatively on par with Germany in terms of renewables, they are just always a bit lacking behind Germany, because their economies are entirely dependant on what Germany does.  
  

I can explain most everything in detail but I deal better with questions because otherwise I have no clue where to start and where to stop and will just ramble on and on and on ^^  

/Edit 2  
The mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece) are pretty fucked in terms of their economy for several years now. Also corruption has always been a problem and government funding is not really a concept that works in these countries (maybe in Spain, theoretically...). So yeah, they just never got any proper funding in place.  
Spain at one point actually was a desirable country for renewable energies, they even have their own manufacturer of wind turbines (Gamesa) but due to their economy, they have trouble financing stuff and now for years haven't been able to pass a new feed-in tariff law, making it unable to realize projects there.  

Eastern Europe currently looks pretty good in terms of renewables. However, the Finance crisis we are currently going through on a global scale (xcept for China maybe) is severely hampering the process of renewables over there as well."
67,2012-07-24 13:52:17,"Another you can use, at least at the casino near me, is to go max out your credit card on gift cards.  Let's say they give you $5000 limit, and the bank is offering 3% back on purchases first 6 months then every day you get $150 from this.  Take the gift certificates to the cage, get $5,000 in chips.  Take the $5,000 in chips to another cage, get cash.  Take cash to your bank reset the balance.  Do again next day.

Edit:  Now that this has received some attention and quite a few questions it'd be nice if a lawyer would comment with the legality of it all.  AFAIK it's 100% legal, the bank would not care at all, and the person losing is the casino because they're paying transaction fees to the bank.  But there is a lot of detailed finance law that I am not 100% familiar with.

Edit2:  I don't want to give up the specific casino where I'm at as it would ruin my game and it's likely not relevant to 99% of people reading this.  It is in America though and if you are really interested in trying this go to a local casino (Indian casino / riverboat most likely, don't think this works for any ""strip casinos"" though small vegas ones mb) and ask if they sell gift cards and if those are redeemable for chips.  If it is, go to BOA, at the least that's the program I used for the 3% cash back for first 6 months and get a card.  Get as high a limit as they'll allow and try it out.  I'm not too sure about this last bit at all but it might be a hell of a way to build credit as well."
68,2012-11-08 08:37:36,"As someone in finance, I get aggravated when I read stories like this and it doesn't actually talk about the fund, its investments or how it made the money."
69,2012-11-30 18:25:14,"This is Canada. You'll like her - she's very nice - can be a little apologetic, but generally very polite and reserved. She's distantly related to the USA - second cousins or something. The difference is that she gets on better with the UK than the USA does. I don't think anyone really dislikes her, but she can get a bit indignant sometimes, and she's not above smeo snide remarks and actions if it comes down to it. I think she's a little insecure about being in the shadow of the USA - she's probably smarter than him (don't tell her though - she's already well possessed of that opinion).

Yeah - don't bother talking to Italy. I don't care if he's handsome - he's a sleazy bastard and we all know it. Some of the shit he's gotten up to - lets just say he lost his virginity way too early, OK. He's got some personal problems too - finance mostly, but he used to make some really bad decisions, and that's messed him up even more. He's too horny and he gets laid way too often - he could do with being taken down a peg or two. I think Germany's looking into that. 

You're going to love Australia - he's a great guy. OK, he's always got a drink in his hand, but he's very laid back, tends to have a sensible grip on life and has a pretty decent disposition for a dude with the neighbours that he has. 

Oh yeah, this is New Zealand. He lives next door to Australia - he's also Australia's only decent neighbour. The kind of weird stuff that goes on in Indonesia - I respect those guys for not going crazy. New Zealand's also fairly laid back - a little less drunk, and a bit more polite, but he's well grounded. Him and Australia are probably the best at contact sports - both big rugby men. For such big guys they're remarkably nice - they probably don't have the aggression to seriously bully anyone. 

That lass there? Ireland. She used to be with the UK group, but she split from them a while ago. Smart girl, and not at all a wilting violet. She enjoys a drink - in all honesty I'm not sure why she's not better friends with Australia for that reason. She's not really popular enough that anyone pays her too much attention, but she's generally liked. Yeah, that's a sexy accent. Get over it. 

Brazil? That guy's the captain of the soccer team, and a real hoot. Great to know him, and great to party with. He's popular, but don't worry about getting excluded - when he parties, everyone's invited! He's colourful, young at heart and catching up fast with the bigger and smarter kids. Don't underestimate him, and don't worry about him either. He's fun, and he's surprisingly practical when it comes to serious matters. 

Argentina? Her and the UK don't get on. There was a feud a while back, she came out worst, and she hasn't gotten over it. She can be a bit moody to be honest, although she's generally pleasant to talk to, and can show some real flair at just about everything - sports, academia, culture. A good friend, but don't upset her. 

Mexico? Well there's an interesting kid. He used to be much smaller, and was a bit of a fanboy around the USA. He's grown up recently though, and he's great to have around, but he does have a bit of a drug problem that he's been fighting unsuccessfully for a while now. That aside, he is a great conversation, and he's smart. Don't rule him out. 

This is India. He's clever, but still needs to get his act together. he has great potential, like china, but it's going to take some time. He still has quite a few problems to sort out, but we're very hopeful for him. He doesn't get along with Pakistan well at all. 

Pakistan is surprisingly similar to India. Don't ever tell him I said that. Him and India don't get along, but they really are making one hell of an effort to sort out their problems. 

Oh, here's Japan. He's incredibly smart, and very mathematical. If someone comes up with an idea, you can bet that he'll improve on it. He's also incredibly brave - he had a lot of ideas impressed upon him when he was a kid, but he's gotten over most of the nutty ones now. Most people like him, but China seems to have some issues. He's a real nerd, but don't think for a minute that he's to be dismissed - he's cleverer than you, and you will need his help. He's also surprisingly generous and kind - although he's a bit awkward around girls. Shame really - he'd probably be an awesome boyfriend. 

The African nations are rather small, and a few tend to be lumped in with the Middle East. Some of them are plain fucked up - The Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo are nuts, and Somalia has more problems than any human can deal with, let alone her. I doubt she even knows who she is. Kenya seems to be a little more stable now, although she wasn't always like that, and South Africa's probably the biggest one there. He can be a bit of a douche, but he's basically all right. He seems to be good mates with Australia and New Zealand. Botswana's a lovely girl - very quiet, almost never speaks, but she's surprisingly well adjusted, given the company she keeps. Zimbabwe - that lad's had more problems than anyone could care to count. He used to be pretty smart, but he lost it a long time ago. He's a mess now. Mauritania is the one you really want to avoid - he's not so much crazy as just dark. He's into some pretty weird stuff, and none of it nice. Don't give Nigeria any money - I don't know what he spends it on, but you'll never see it again. 

Peru and Columbia are a bit like Mexico - getting there, but they still have a bit of a drug problem. 

Holland is a great guy - he's smart, loves sports and is quite arty too. He's also baked most evenings, and he doesn't mind who he shares his weed with, as long as you go to his house to smoke it. 

Belgium is a quiet girl, a little weird if you ask me, but a lot smarter than we give her credit for. 

The Korea Brothers are a mismatched pair. South is clever, and very mature for his age. North is nuts - we're worried that he's going to blow up the school one day. He threatens violence against South about 6 times a day, but we all know he's talking bollocks. He seems to have calmed down a little recently, but he's not anywhere near stable yet. 

You want my advice? Date Denmark, or maybe Norway. Make friends with Japan, and the Scandinavian kids. Be on good terms with the UK and the USA - don't fuck with them, but don't get too close. The same goes for Germany. Stay away from North Korea, and the Middle East. Bigger and smarter countries than you have tried and failed there. You can try to be friends with the African Countries, but don't invest yourself. Every time they make progress at least one of them fucks up big time. Don't get mixed up with the Middle East, and dear sweet fuck don't go near Israel. South Korea's a good study buddy, and Australia's a good mate to have. Don't get too mixed up with Brazil - he's great and all, but he parties too damn much and he's just a distraction. "

72,2012-04-12 18:17:31,"I'm sure no one will see this comment, but I just wanted to give you a post in solidarity.

I was a loyal Sprint customer for six years. I historically mistrusted cell companies, so when I went with Sprint back in the day, I paid extra for a one year contract. I liked their service and the phone so much, that I kept the same service and same phone at a VERY expensive monthly fee for an additional five years. I was out of contract for the entire time, they had no hold on me, and I could easily have gotten a cheaper plan. But, I liked Sprint a lot, and brand loyalty means something to me, so I just stuck with them.

Shortly after the Nextel merger, a charge for a four hour phone call appeared on my monthly bill. The fee was upwards of $200 for this call. At the time, I had something like a 100 minute/month plan. I barely talk on the phone, and mostly just text, plus I still had a landline. Obviously, this took me by surprise.

I called and explained the charge was in error. They told me there was nothing they could do. I asked for the number the call was connected to. They refused to give it to me. I explained that the call was not recorded in the non-user-editable call history on my phone. They didn't care. They wouldn't even tell me whether the call in question was incoming or outgoing. I escalated the ticket, and was told someone would get back to me.

You know how they got back to me? By forwarding my account to collections less than a WEEK after I made that phone call. The bill wasn't even overdue yet. They trashed my perfect credit rating, and fought me tooth and nail as I worked to fix it. Eventually, I ran out of money and time and I was forced to simply pay off the fee and deal with my now-shitty credit (which really screwed me when I needed to finance a car a couple years later).

Traditionally, I fucking hate when people mention Reddit in conversations with CSRs, and that would be a downvote offense. But because it's Sprint, all I can say is ... I understand. Here, have an upvote. I'd give you more if I could.

**TL;DR - Sprint fucked a loyal customer right in the ass. They are a goddamned morally corrupt, rotting cesspool of a company.** "
73,2012-11-01 09:40:18,"I had been dating a girl for about four years and she seemed perfect. We had been living together for two years and had had no relationship problems that I was really aware of.  We both took jobs in a different state (the same state, same company, same town) and were going to move in about 6 months or so. My job required me to go and complete training in a completely different state until then.

So, I say goodbye to my fiance and travel off to this third state where I live on a shoestring in order to finance our almost cross-country move.  While I'm away, my fiance starts telling me that she's been spending a lot of time with this female friend of mine that I introduced her to. My fiance was bisexual, and we had had discussions about certain ""open-ness"" in our relationship, so I wasn't worried. In fact, I was happy that she wasn't as lonely as she kept telling me she was.

After about six months, I travel back home. My fiance doesn't greet me at the door - in fact, she had my only key and didn't answer her phone so I had to sit outside of our apartment with my luggage waiting for thirty minutes. Eventually aforementioned mutual friend drives up, my fiance gets out, and the friend leaves without a word or a wave.  My fiance tells me she had forgotten that I was getting in that day (despite me having texted/emailed her earlier).  I shrug it off and we go inside and keep packing.

We packed for about a week and the whole time she refused to sleep at our apartment (claiming that it was too uncomfortable to sleep on a foam mattress on the floor) and stayed at her now-girlfriend's place.  At the end of the week, we loaded up a truck and drove to our new state.

Things seemed fine. She was smiling and happy. We got to the apartment that I had paid for in advance, a 2-story apartment with a fireplace, balcony, the works. It was supposed to be the stepping stone for a new life. She seemed happy, started unpacking her suitcase, set our cats out to explore.  I started unloading the truck.

Three days later, I had finally finished unloading the truck. The fridge had food, the couches and bed were set up, the place was looking close to a real home.  She was aloof, quiet. I kept asking what was wrong, she wouldn't tell me. She refused to talk. I tried to sit next to her and talk but she said she was fine and she just needed to be quiet and alone for a bit. I said sure, if that's what she wanted then I'd let her have it. I went to bed somewhat early as I had unpacked most of the truck by myself.

I woke up at 5am to a text message from her saying ""I'm safe - I left you a note"". I immediately start crying because any idiot knows this means bad news.

The note was a 2 page letter that was held to the fridge downstairs by a magnet. It was a long treatise about how she never really loved me and only started dating me as a rebound and then stayed with me when she realized I treated her better than anyone else had and that I was able to give her the best sex she had ever had in her life.  She noted that she came to the conclusion (with the help of her new girlfriend) that she didn't love me ever, and in fact, according to her girlfriend, I was abusive and she needed to leave me for someone else. The gist of the letter was that I should feel bad about how bad of a person I was/am and that I needed to be out of the apartment by the time she got back from her ski vacation (a week's time) or else she would make me get out.

This is where my life fell apart. I was in a new town that I had only been in for about four days, I had no money because I spent it all on my cross-country move, and now I was homeless.  I didn't want to fight because i was tired and emotionally destroyed (I was supposed to spend my life with this woman) so I started packing up my car (at least I had a car) and went to work as usual and spent most of the next couple of days looking for a new apartment.  I eventually just threw in the towel and moved back to where I was living prior. Thankfully, I was able to keep my new job.

However, the emotional scars still run deep (as I'm sure they do for a lot of people posting here) and I still have deep and powerful trust issues and am highly paranoid without warrant.

Sorry for the wall of text.

**tl;dr: Fiance leaves me a letter after 4 years telling me she never loved me and was only with me for the sex. She then kicks me out of the apartment in a new city with no money.**

Look at the core of her action- she is putting her desires above your own.  She is putting her desires for kids NOW above your desire to have a family when you are ready, and attempting to (against your will) entrap you for ~20 years of child raising you don't want.  She obviously has little or no respect for you or your desires or your plans for life, only her own.

You need to get the fuck out now.  Don't wait for her to get back from here trip.  Pack your shit up while shes away (before she can fuck with it) and move it all out of her place(s), then get the locks changed on any of your place(s) she has access to.  

The most important thing- be strong when she gets back.  She will cry and beg and all that but you have to stick firm.  If she was willing to treat you with so little respect now, and you say you have conversations like this a lot, do you really want to be stuck with her for 20 years?  I didn't think so.

Lastly, I'm sure you're worried about losing two years.  Well let me tell you in the finance world, there's a saying - Don't throw good money after bad.  It means when you make a bad investment in a company that is going downhill, don't keep pouring more good money into the company trying to turn it around and recover your initial investment, you'll just lose that money too.

The same applies to you my friend.  You've invested two years in her and gotten disrespect and betrayal for it, the proof is in your hand and posted on imgur.  Sure that's a long time, but 20 years is your whole youth.  You don't want to lose that all raising a kid with a crazy woman."
77,2012-09-25 20:49:52,"Infantry is awesome. At the end of the day, you work harder and are more disciplined, combat-competent, filthy, sweaty, exhausted, freezing, broiling, hungry than any other regular job in the military. You get to become proficient with a plethora of weapons, mind-boggling communication systems, tactical vehicles, and drilled-into-you tactics that you get to doing instinctively without even thinking about it. 

Infantry sucks ass. You are treated like shit by high-level leadership. You enlisted to kick doors and shoot people in the face, but there you are picking moss out of the cracks in the garrison sidewalk because General Fucknut is coming to give a 3 hour speech about whogivesafuck. You embark on an 18-mile roadmarch; 26 miles later, your feet are hamburger and your 16-pound machine gun feels like it weighs 56 pounds. You stand guard at a weapons range in the sub-freezing temps for hours on-end, hours after the range went ""cold"" (no more firing), on a secure garrison, because you ""train like you fight."" You show up for formation in the freezing rain; one guy forgot his gloves; everybody has to take their gloves off. You get your long-awaited weekend snatched away for CQ (charge of quarters = barracks desk duty) or battalion/brigade staff duty or courtesy patrol (even though there are such things as MPs) or a work detail or because your leadership fucked up scheduling and the ONLY day open for the weapons range is on the weekend. 

You deploy and live in dust-caked tents while a hundred meters away, personnel clerks and finance desk-jockeys who will never leave the FOB are living in air-conditioned housing units. You go on patrol for 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 or more hours at a time, come back to the FOB and get in line for a hot meal; too bad, says the dining hall guard: your uniform is too dirty to come inside. You are moved out to a combat outpost with no running water and no electricity (other than the radios at the command post) and live there for a few weeks at a time; when you're not on-mission, you're in a guard tower, or fixing vehicles, or burning shit in oil-drums, or digging ditches, or stringing razorwire, or filling sandbags, or rolling out on QRF (quick reaction force) to help a patrol who got hit, or you're cleaning your weapon. If you have time to eat, masturbate, sleep, and wipe your asscrack off with babywipes, you do it. 

You train for 14 weeks to earn those blue disks, crossed rifles and blue cord (if you're a Marine, you train for 26 weeks, and I don't know what infantry-specific accoutrements USMC infantrymen get, forgive my ignorance, fellow grunts) and train for months or even a year further at your line unit to deploy to combat. You learn how to use almost every gun we have, you learn how to drive (and maybe gun) Humvees, Bradleys, Strykers, MRAPs (unit-dependent) and practice shooting with night-vision and infrared lasers, or night-vision or thermal scopes. You and your buddies give each other IVs with night-vision in the back of a moving Bradley for combat-lifesaver training. You itch for the day you deploy, while the veterans around you roll their eyes, having already seen what you yearn for.

You get there and the enemy hides in civilian clothes; he uses women and children for human shields and spotters for mortar attacks. He kidnaps people from opposite tribes/sects and rapes women and murders children and tortures people with power drills to their kneecaps and cheeks and he cuts the tongue out of a 13 year old boy because the kid chatted with you during a halt on-mission. He kills your friends with sniper rifles and IEDs and you rarely, if ever, even see him face-to-face. You probably won't get the opportunity to kill him; rarely will you get the opportunity to even shoot at him. When you finally get that chance, you won't feel a thing. You won't be happy that he's laying there in front of you, bleeding and moaning on the pavement. You'll see dead people... civilians killed by them, killed accidentally by us, indigenous security forces (cops, military, local hired militia), bad guys... you may see people die right in front of you, within mere meters. At the end of it, you'll be dull. Numb. Desensitized. You'll wish you fired your weapon more. 

You'll come home and be unable to relate to the friends and family who clapped you on the back and wished you well when you left those few short years ago. You'll know that you were the very top of the food chain; only special operations direct action teams trained more, did more, saw more, and were in more danger than you were. And your future college classmates will find out you were in the military and say things like, ""Oh, my cousin is in the Navy, I think he does something with computers. He went to Iraq; it must've been SCARY."" Or, ""My buddy Joe joined the Army. Did you know him?"" Or, ""Did you KILL ANYBODY?"" Or, ""I support you guys, but I oppose the war. You didn't really believe in what we're doing over there, RIGHT?"" 

The highs are higher; relationships are more passionate (and more quickly burned out), weekends and block-leave periods are cherished, and days you somehow don't get put on the tower guard roster are things to behold. 

The lows are lower; I think I already summed them up. 

Caveat: tankers, scouts, combat engineers, and arty guys (the other combat-arms MOS) are cool too. And medics/corpsmen, EOD, dog handlers, psyops, civil affairs, JTACs, and pilots. I don't mean to seem like I'm marginalizing every other military MOS aside from Army/USMC infantry.

The beer I'm drinking right now is one of the best beers I've ever had. Because it's Labatt-Infantry-Blue, bitches. "
78,2012-12-14 08:16:21,"I loved his comments on it, that they just were trying to see what they could legally do. Colbert and his writers were learning about the rarelytalked about Super PAC world and turned it into a comedy that educated millions of people... young people... on campaign finance and the shady shit that is allowed to go down."
79,2012-02-06 08:11:38,"If you're still in college, it's going to be tough for me to convince you not to work in finance.  You probably have your mind set on investment banking, sales &amp; trading or ""working at a hedge fund.""  I'll share with you a few professional observations over my life that might help you change your mind.

* Even if you do get a job in finance, the chances that you'll make it anywhere near the point where you'll be making ""good money"" are pretty small.  While banks hire in ""big"" classes, those classes dwindle pretty quickly.  Some people drop out due to disillusionment, but most are simply fired.  You'll be lucky if you're fired early, by the way - then you can at least get a job doing something else.

* The work isn't all that exciting.  As an investment banker, you'll be doing Excel spreadsheets all day, and all night, and all the next day.  If you get into the ""sales"" part of ""sales and trading,"" you'll be a salesman (something you definitely don't need a degree for).  Chances are - as a salesman - you'll be sitting next an MBA from a top-10 school business school, who *definitely* didn't need that degree to be sitting where he is, either.

* Most of you don't have what it takes to make ""big money"" on Wall Street.  I've known the entire range of people (disclaimer:  I made some 'OK' money for some time) - from those fired early, to one particular friend who is now one of the youngest partners at a major and hated investment bank.  He was one in a million...my more ""middling"" friends were simply lucky, and everyday they worry about losing their jobs.

* You had better like New York (banking, some hedge funds) or Connecticut (most hedge funds).  I say this because at first - at least the first three years - I didn't care for it very much at all.  The area grew on me, and I ended up loving it, but that was not before I had to live through three very depressing years in a high-cost-of-living area with bad traffic and attitudes that (at first) didn't quite dovetail with my ""Midwest sensibilities.""

* Back to luck:  It plays a larger role than you think.  Hard work isn't enough.  Getting placed on the right desk, at the right time, getting to know the right people, finding the right fund, etc. are all crucial ""making it"" in any way on Wall Street.  If one thing fails to align, you're going nowhere, even if you're ""unique"" and ""awesome.""  

* If you're a woman, you'll probably represent 50% of your incoming class, but within two years - if you're still there - you'll go back to representing 10% of your local workforce.  It's a male-dominated industry, and it's not because banks don't try incredibly hard to hire women.

* The business is *highly* cyclical.  I managed to make it through three rounds of cuts at the first bank I worked at (I started mid 2001) before getting cut in the last round about 3.5 years after I started.  I saw one roommate, and well over 2/3 of my class cut within that time.  I was lucky in that the financial economy was really picking up steam as my bank made the final round of cuts, and found my first hedge fund position rather quickly.  One of my friends called me last week (he was once my roommate; still at the bank).  He let me know they cut half his desk that day.  It would have been him, but another guy just above him kindof wanted to leave.  He was relieved, to say the least.

* Finally - and I can't stress this enough.  If you're ultimately fired after a mildly successful initial career, *you won't leave with any skills you can apply anywhere else.*  In other words, once you're in the finance business, you're stuck there.  Sure, you can go work as a financial adviser, work at a pension or endowment, a financial analyst (if you have the skills), but nobody cares about your computer skills, your work ethic, or your Ivy League degree when your 10 years of experience comes from specialized financial work that lacks application in 95% of the rest of the real economy.

So, that was my quickie list of bullet points for those who are at good schools considering ""the business.""  I doubt what I say here will change anybody's mind, but that won't be because what I've added isn't true, or because ""I don't know what I'm talking about.""  

Good luck to you -

81,2012-09-13 05:02:30,"I am 54 years old, so I am closer to retirement than most other redditors.

I grew up poor (actually, US lower class), but eventually graduated from university and have had a long career in a lucrative field (software engineering).

Here is what I have done and learned:

  * Save 10-40 percent of your income.  I became self employed relatively early in my career, and this afforded me the option of using Keogh and SEP retirement accounts to stash away up to half of my earnings.
  * Live within your means (after the tithe to savings account).  I did buy ""toys"", but never on extended credit.^1  I rarely bought something for which I didn't have the immediate funds available to pay for it.  This does not mean I didn't use credit cards.  I often did so to build up a credit rating, but I did ...
  * Pay off revolving credit card in full every month.  Do not carry a balance.  Do not pay interest or finance charges.  In the 35 years I have had credit cards, I can count the number of times I carried a balance from one month to the next on one hand.  This helps you build a credit history without forking over your hard-earned cash to the banks for that privilege.
  * Avoid financing automobiles.  I admit I financed my first two cars after college - all the rest I bought *cash* from savings.  Do *not* get trapped into the cycle of buying a car on a 5-6 year loan, then trading it in after a couple of years for another new car on another 5-6 year loan.  You will end up paying interest on your car loans for decades.  This is often a trap for young college grads.  That new BMW vs a used Subaru is a costly mistake.  When I bought my first car in 1982, interest rates on used car loans were 18 percent.  I payed it off in 18 months.
  * Buy a house now, if you can afford it and you expect to stay in the area for a while.  I did not buy a house until I was 44 years old.  For me that was a somewhat wise decision because house prices were high in the areas I could work and mortgage interest rates were also quite high.  However, since the housing bubble burst in 2008, the cost of houses has dropped up to 40 percent, mortgage interest rates are at record lows (~3 percent APR), and the mortgage interest tax deduction can reduce your federal tax burden.
  * Shit happens. No matter now much you plan (or deny the inevitable) crap will rain down on you at some point. I had an automobile mechanic skip town, leaving my car locked in his shop - sans transmission.  I was run off the road on my bicycle and broke a vertebrae and clavicle in the crash.  Have a ""rainy-day fund"" for such rainy days.
  * At this time, you will need $2-3M in assets *per family member* to retire in comfort. This seems high, but inflation and high health care costs have a significant impact.
  * There are no pockets in shrouds (aka: you can't take it with you).  You don't know if you will die tomorrow or live 'til you're 120.  You need to keep a balance between living with $20K/month credit card debt and living like Ebenezer Scrooge.  I went to Italy for 6 weeks and loved it, but I wouldn't want to do it if I was confined to a walker or couldn't spend the night in a B&amp;B without crapping the bed.  Postponing all the ""fun"" in your life until you could no longer enjoy it is not worth it.  My mother died at 70.5 years old.  She hadn't yet collected a full year of Social Security, drove a really shitty car, rarely travelled or ate out, and wouldn't pay the extra $5/month for HDTV (even though she had a 52-inch flat-screen TV).
  * Don't smoke cigarettes.  They cost a ton of money over a lifetime, and leave you in poor health when you want to retire and enjoy life.

1. Zero percent interest should come into account here.  I once bought a computer with 0 percent 18-month financing.  I payed it in full 17 months into the loan and kept the interest I earned in the mean time. But *always* pay it back before the due-date, or they will slap you for the whole 18 months of accumulated interest at once.

So the real point is - moderation.  Don't spend everything.  Don't spend nothing.  And certainly don't spend more than you have.

Edit(s): clarity."

TLDR: 'multi-level marketing' is essentially pyramid selling.

84,2012-02-14 15:27:59,"I did something similar a couple years ago.  I had just gotten a new cell phone number, and started getting harassed by Capital One Auto Finance, looking for someone named Brenda.

They would call every hour on the hour, seven days a week, starting at 6am until you picked up the phone.  I told the callers on multiple occasions that they had the wrong number, which would stop the calls for the rest of the day, but they'd start up at 6am the next day.

The callers said that unless I provided new contact information for Brenda, they would treat me as if I were lying and continue to call.  Every time I asked for a supervisor, they hung up on me.

After putting up with this for over a week, I got an idea.  The next time they called and asked for Brenda, I said I was her husband and that she was unavailable.  They proceeded to tell me how far behind I was on my car payment, so I told them we didn't want the car anymore and dared them to come repossess it.  I never heard from them again.

Looking back on it, I probably got some poor girl's car repossessed, but at least I got the calls to stop."

Gov. Romney, do you have any response to the reports that Candidate Romney is calling you a liar?

**Edit**: 
- Romney has been criticized by experts for failing to deliver on issues of business development and economic growth after selling himself as the “CEO governor.”

- After calling for economic divestment from Iran, Romney was embarrassed by revelation that the Italian
branch of Bain &amp; Company – firm where Romney started as young consultant and served as CEO in early
‘90s – received $2.3 million contract from National Iranian Oil Company in 2004.

- Romney has proposed doubling the size of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and supports “enhanced
interrogation techniques.”

**Edit 2**: I think the Campaign Finance section is my favorite so far:

- In 2002, Romney proposed installing 10 percent tax on private donations to political campaigns.

- Romney once proposed capping spending on elections, abolishing PACs and “tightening regulations.”"

92,2012-12-01 12:42:34,"Zero debt is actually a bad thing for a country or large business to have. 

The straight costs and opportunity costs of capital can exceed he cost of debt, making it inefficient to finance purely with capital.

This is why even a company like ~~apple~~ Toyota, or a fiscally prudent country will still issue debt before raising additional capital. It is cheaper.

Edit: Apple was a bad case, because they apparently can't find any investment that will net them more than inflation. Having that large of a cash pile sitting around is not ideal for them.

95,2012-08-18 17:58:48,"The issue is there aren't any Federal elections; well, there's really only one, and its held by the Electoral College where 538 representatives from the 50 States meet in their respective state capitals to elect the President. When you vote in a State's Presidential Election, you are not actually voting for a President, you are voting for Electors who will vote according to the preference of the people who elected them (though they don't actually have to). Most states it is all or nothing, for example, California's 55 electoral college representatives go to the winner of the State's popular vote. The vote may be 20 million to 15 million, but the candidate that wins gets all 55 votes. Some states, however, can divide their electoral votes proportionately with the popular vote, with the winner getting an extra for winning, etc... but all of this is decided on the State level, with no Federal involvement.

What this means is that a Presidential Election is not one big election, but rather 50 separate elections for electors who will vote accordingly in the electoral college.

So then you register on the State level for elections, but since there is no centralization, you could potentially register in multiple state's, etc... vote in different counties, vote as someone else, etc...

This never really happens but state governments are filled with idiots, trolls, etc... because qualified people have no interest in State level politics except for Governor etc... They go into business, finance, law, medicine, science, or the federal government. State politics is too small a game, so in the after math of the New Deal and a lot of progressivism up until Regan, you get Republicans re-examing their strategy, and working hard on the lower levels to control state governments and create laws which will help them win on a national level. They are expert at jerrymandering (redistricting) and are generally very coordinated.

They fight so hard because on a very basic level it is virtually impossible for a Republican to win any election without these components. There are about 72 million Democrats, 55 million Republicans, and 42 million independents. All things being equal, Republicans would lose, so they need these other strategies to ""level"" the field.

The main issue is that most of the powers that be in the US are not actually interested in a proper democratic election, and the Republicans CERTAINLY are not, because in a proper democratic election lots of blacks, minorities, and the elderly vote, and Republicans lose. But they have enough power to maintain the status quo, so they fight as hard as they can to do so. The fewer people that vote, the more important each vote is, and, Republican's are good at getting a high turnout while Democrats have trouble getting as many people to vot

Remember, at no point in the US history has there been an unimpeded right to vote. Originally, it was only propertied white men that could vote, and over hundreds of years blacks, women, etc... have been included, poll taxes have been eliminated (reduced, since this voter ID thing counts as a poll tax) but if people don't make you let them vote, why make it easy for them? It is a selfish way of looking at things, but that often comes hand in hand with the desire for power.

So think about this in the context that there are something like 215 million eligible voters in the US, so if only 140-160mm (last I'd heard it was like 63%) are registered, you're already increasing the power of one vote, and reducing the number of votes needed to win an election at all levels. Having voter registration which is not automatic, means fewer people will register ahead of time, which means fewer people will vote. Its a time and effort barrier in and of itself, but its intentional, and in the grand tradition of keeping power until someone makes you give it up.

Additionally, there is an issue that most Republicans believe that Chicago Mayor Richard Daley stole the 1960 Presidential Election in which JFK was elected, creating an emotional backdrop which Republicans use to convert semi-believers to firm believers about voter fraud. There are very few, if any, verifiable cases of dead people voting, or people voting multiple times.

Could this easily be solved? Solving it would require many changes to the broader system which would result in the destruction of one of the two entrenched political parties, and in fact, could diminish the power of both by creating a shift toward a multi-party system, so in a simple answer: No.

I should also point out that our founders really never anticipated that a two party system would be able to dominate American politics and warned against it. America was too big and factionalized, but technology, over time, changed that. Railroads, cars, the interstate highway system, the efficiency of the postal service, the telegraph, the telephone, etc... all made the nation much smaller and made coordination between the States easier. The all or nothing nature of most apportionment of electors and the lack of runoffs, when combined with the possibility of interstate coordination creates a mathematical inevitability of a shift toward either a two party system, or a uniparty system, which is in fact what we have right now, with the majority, or core committees of both Democrats and Republicans really just being two sides of the same coin.

Hope that helps.

Edit: Since people are reading this I thought I'd mention people should check out some of the comments from others below, there's some good stuff that I did not cover, ie why it was done this way in the first place (that it made more sense when everything was representative and there was originally no direct election of a president), one guy notes that we have precincts for super granular representation (Mayors, state or city assemblymen, etc...), and others note, fairly, that both sides gerrymander... one could obviously write quite a bit more on this subject."

The smartest way to buy anything is to finance for the shortest amount of time while putting the most possible down you can afford.
