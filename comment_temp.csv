250M in total annual revenue doesn't mean they have 250M dollars. Jesus H Christ in the morning. It means 250M in sales annually. Deduct from that all employee salaries, all costs of goods sold, all rent and other expenses, and you are left with net income. Tax that and pay the taxes, and you get net income after taxes, which is generally plowed back into the company by using it to expand operations and hire more people, sell more stuff, etc..

It doesn't tell you anything about how much net worth her family has or how much annual income they have. 

This is the root of class warfare in the world today. The 99% don't know how the hell capitalism even works. They take calculus and literature, but can't buy stocks and don't know how interest or financial statements work. It's like learning latin to do astronomy - your liberal arts education is worthless in a world where the language is money/accounting/finance.

The NDAA would give enough room to detain US citizens if someone wanted to interpret it that way. The Patriot Act already allows for all the things people are scared about, the NDAA only crystallizes those rights on top of the fun fact that the US is officially at war, across the world, against an eternal enemy.

Obama's signing statement (for what it's worth) claimed their administration wouldn't jail US citizens without a trial. However that doesn't say anything about the next administration, and again, even if US citizens are not affected, jailing or assassinating 'brown people' because you suspect them of terrorism is insane, especially since those who flew those planes on 9/11 also died on 9/11.

Weren't they Saudis anyway? Didn't the US just sell $60bn worth of planes, bombs and equipment to the Saudis? And while I'm on a rant, didn't the US sell weapons to Iraq *and* Iran when they were at war against each other, even though Congress said they couldn't, then covertly used some of the profits to finance contras in Nicaragua, even though Congress said they couldn't? Didn't they try to cover up how Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons on its own citizens and Iranians, then 20 years later came out and said they thought he *did* have chemical weapons, but it turned out he didn't, and for some reason no one remembers the 80's, then they attacked Iraq and killed Saddam Hussein, and now they're covertly at war with Iran?

7,2012-01-01 14:27:37,"I use to be the GM at the third largest dealership in the country.

In my opinion here is the most effective way to negotiate.


1. If you are paying cash or making payments have real understanding of what you REALLY can afford, (98% buyers want to buy more than they can afford).

2. Financing - find out what your credit score is (it is not my fault you are a subprime buyer).

3. Cash buyer - this means you are taking the money from a savings account, (if you got a loan at your bank or credit union - you are a payment buyer).

4. Trade in - do some research to determine what your trade is worth minus the repair work it is going to need. If you know your trade is only worth $5,000 don't insist you should get $8,000 because you saw a similar vehicle advertised for $8,000 or more.

Tip- if a trade has a real value of (example) $10,000 it may only be worth $8,000 to a dealership for these reasons, (new tires, new windshield, new brakes, dent repair, paint repair, interior repair-all of these have a cost to repair). 

Every used vehicle buyer expects/demands the USED vehicle they are buying to be in perfect shape or as I use to hear (as good as if it was new). 

5. New - Use all of the resources available on the internet to price a new vehicle. 

next determine how much profit you are willing to pay - (Note - if you offer invoice or less don't expect me to give you a free loaner, pay for the damage you did to your vehicle, free oil changes).
 
Easiest way to buy /negotiate for a new vehicle at a dealership.

The invoice is $XX,XXX I will offer $XXX over invoice, plus tax and (title usually $25.00 to $50.00). They will respond with the invoice and the bottom line.

Used - look through the ads in the local newspaper, look at the online used vehicle portals. Gather intel on the type of vehicle you are interested in, (what influences the price of used - mileage, overall condition, how good the model moves). If paper and portals show a vehicle is worth $XX,XXX with 80,000+ miles and you are negotiating on a vehicle with 28,000 miles it is going to cost you more).

Financing - if you have set up your financing with a bank or Credit Union take the time listen to the F&amp;I Manager, see what options they may have for you. If it is not a better deal finance with your source.

Service Contracts - Do you need one? Yes... and... No, this is a personal decision. All USED Vehicles are sold AS IS. 

After the purchase - if you DID NOT buy a service contract DONT ask the dealership to pay for repairs/ damaged you did to the vehicle, or free oil changes. You are over 18, can read and write it is time to accept responsibility for your decisions!

GAP - (financing) if you DO NOT put down 20% plus taxes Seriously considering buying gap, it may be the only thing that saves you financially if you total your vehicle!

This is the single number one reason why people take a hit on any vehicle purchase – Sales Tax. 

The value of the vehicle did not change! When people come back 6 months later, we tell them here is the price for your trade, they respond with “I am losing $X,XXX dollar amount”. No you are not losing the value of the vehicle you are only losing the sales tax you paid.

Ron Paul would have had the system collapse to let the market decide, leaving the people to pay even harder for their mistakes than they already are.

14,2012-01-01 13:22:40,"A derivative is simply a contract between two people based on (generally) the price of a share or an asset. I think the name comes from the fact that the contract is *derived* from the price of the underlying asset.

First off, an asset price or a share *price* is simply the number that the asset or share is currently trading at in the market. So currently I can buy a [share in Google at a price of 645](http://www.google.co.uk/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOG), or [a gram of gold for £32](http://goldprice.org/gold-price-per-gram.html). The fact that you might think the gold will make a pretty ring and value it higher is not relevant here.

So the share price itself is technically a derivative: When you buy a share off a broker, it is really (sort of) an agreement that he will buy it back at whatever price it is trading at. But what about some more common and exciting derivatives?

Perhaps the easiest derivative to understand is the *future*. A future is ""a contract to buy or sell an asset on or before a future date at a price specified today."" (Thanks, wiki!) What does that mean, and why on earth would I want one? Turns out there are lots of reasons!

Imagine you are an airline company, and I'm a oil company. You want to buy fuel off me to fly your planes, and I want your money. It might be sensible for you to buy a forward on the fuel at the beginning of the year, so that every month you get fuel delivered to you at a predetermined price. This means that there won't be any nasty surprises for you if the price of fuel goes up. In this case, the future acts as *insurance* against the rising cost of fuel. In reality, someone else (an investment bank) might deal with the future for us. Then I'm happy because I know I have a consistent income this year.

Another reason to buy a future is for *hedging*. This is an attempt protect yourself against something bad happening to something you own (or expect to own in the future). Wikipedia explains this well:

**Agricultural commodity price hedging**
""A typical hedger might be a commercial farmer. The market values of wheat and other crops fluctuate constantly as supply and demand for them vary, with occasional large moves in either direction. Based on current prices and forecast levels at harvest time, the farmer might decide that planting wheat is a good idea one season, but the forecast prices are only that — forecasts. Once the farmer plants wheat, he is committed to it for an entire growing season. If the actual price of wheat rises greatly between planting and harvest, the farmer stands to make a lot of unexpected money, but if the actual price drops by harvest time, he could be ruined.
If at planting time the farmer sells a number of wheat futures contracts equivalent to his anticipated crop size, he effectively locks in the price of wheat at that time: the contract is an agreement to deliver a certain number of bushels of wheat to a specified place on a certain date in the future for a certain fixed price. The farmer has hedged his exposure to wheat prices; he no longer cares whether the current price rises or falls, because he is guaranteed a price by the contract. He no longer needs to worry about being ruined by a low wheat price at harvest time, but he also gives up the chance at making extra money from a high wheat price at harvest times.""

The farmer will own the wheat in the future, so he is happy to sell it now, and deliver it when it is grown.

Many, many derivatives have real world uses like the one above, even seemingly complicated ones.

Problems can arise for a number of reasons. To see why, let's go back to the fuel future I sold your airline. You were happy to get your fuel for a set price. If the price goes down due to new technology, you've missed out on an opportunity to save some money, and I will make a profit as I can can get the fuel for much less than I sold it to you. But that was the risk you took for peace of mind. However, if the price of fuel goes up a lot, I still have to supply it to you at a large loss to myself! In fact, my potential losses are infinite, as there is no upper limit to the price of oil. That single futures contract could potentially take down my whole business! Here's an example (again from Wikipedia):

""The loss of US$6.4 billion in the failed fund Amaranth Advisors, which was long natural gas in September 2006 when the price plummeted.""

""long natural gas"" simply means that Amaranth had agreed to buy natural gas at a certain price, expecting to sell it later. But now gas was so cheap, they weren't able to get any money back!

So that's one reason why derivatives can be dangerous. They open you up to a lot of risk (the technical term for this is high *gearing*, or high *leverage*. This means small changes in price of the underlying asset (i.e. the actual thing being traded) can have large effects on the value of the derivative.

Here are some more reasons that derivatives might be dangerous, I can expand on them if you like, or others can:

* They can be hard to value. In the air line example, the cost of entering into the future would have to be calculated using lots of maths - the probabilities of oil prices rising, new technologies being invented etc. This means they are prone to over and undervaluation. If I am a bank and buy something that I think is worth $2billion, but it is actually just worth $1billion, I just wiped a billion dollars off my bottom line. Whoops.

* Related to the above, wrapping everything above makes it hard to understand what something you are buying actually *is*. The future I described above is fairly simple to understand, but a complicated repackaging of bits of many different mortgages might not be.

* Risk of domino effects: If I buy some gold, and the value falls to zero, then only I have lost money. But if I was going to sell that gold and use that to pay a debt, then I no longer can. This means that the business I owed it to is out money, and maybe they can't pay their debts either. In this way, we can get a 'domino effect'. The reason derivatives can be especially harmful in this respect is that they are not subject to as much regulation as other assets. For example, you might (legally) have to prove you can pay a normal debt to me even if you don't have any gold, but there might not be any legal restrictions if we trade a derivative.

I hope that helps (and is correct), please ask for clarifications or expansions. As always, compliments and constructive criticism are very much appreciated.

16,2012-01-01 11:48:32,"That's guaranteed to fix things. /s

Voting out *every* incumbent and replacing them with a fresh congressperson would not do much to fix the broken system of campaign finance which makes them beholden to lobbyists for big-money interests. In fact, fresh representatives would probably be *more* susceptible to lobbying and influence -- they have more to gain and must play safe while they learn the game. 

Broken Congress is not a personal or party problem, it's a systemic problem. Solution lies in reforming campaign finance, and probably needs to start with Congress passing laws mandating public funding of campaigns and banning private fundraising (except *maybe* very small, personal donations, say $10/person), and also Supreme Court reversing the decision that money is speech. I'm not holding my breath. "
17,2012-01-01 14:57:40,"*Former car salesman as well* - NO good dealership will let you call the previous owner. It's a violation of that person's privacy. I would say most of the used cars at a dealership weren't trade-ins anyways - they were bought at auction, so the dealer likely doesn't even have that information if they wanted to give it out.

As for negotiating, you're in a tough spot because who knows what kind of markup they have. They may have bought it at a decent price then found something wrong with it and had to sink $2-4k into it before they could sell it. A new/used dealership will generally not purposely sell a car known to be defective. It's just not worth their reputation.

So, the price they have it listed at might have $7k in markup or it could potentially be nearly at a loss. Your best bet is to shop around, get a good feel for what vehicles like that are going for, and be willing to walk away. Used cars are unique and if you're telling the guy you can get one like that for $1k less somewhere else they know you're either lying or there is a reason you're still here trying to get this one (color, condition, etc). 

If you're coming in off an ad then the price listed is probably the lowest they will go. They advertise very aggressively and usually try to make sure they are the cheapest or at least as cheap as they can go. I wouldn't expect much if any wiggle room.

I don't care if you aren't trading in and I don't really care how you pay. The finance department cares because they make money selling loans but the sales department doesn't really care. I sell the car, it's their job to sell the financing. I actually prefer no trade in as people always think their cars are worth more than they are and it's just another point to have to negotiate."

If anything, the result of campaign finance reform has been to make money much more important in politics--the opposite of their intended purpose. Before, when candidates could just take massive amounts of money from a few sources and in places where that is still legal (like Indiana, for instance), candidates spend very little time raising money.

After you've paid down your debt, continue this strategy to save for a car, house, etc.  

Don't make the huge mistake of living beyond your means like a lot of people our age do.  Don't spend more than you make and continue to educate yourself on personal finance.  "

32,2012-01-01 03:23:20,"&gt;Grail is the 110th mission to target the moon since the dawn of the Space Age...

Very cool; I did not know the number was that high. Congratulations, NASA!

GRAIL will be able to answer questions we should have handled decades ago. Knowing how our moon became the way it is would reveal much about the celestial history of our own planet, and likely much about its geological history.

But I've got a disclaimer on this subject, a personal interest beyond the value of pure science: if GRAIL is able to distinguish some areas on or near the lunar surface as denser than the surrounding average, we would likely be seeing the earliest prospects for future mining sites. I really do want working lunar mining sites.

Nobody's going to start pulling metal ores from the Moon in the immediate future, but there would be a lot of interest in missions to retrieve samples. If NASA were able and willing to auction off its collection of moon rocks, it could raise enough money to finance bringing back more. NASA isn't going to do any such thing... but that doesn't stop others from seeing the value and opportunity there.

In the future we will be able to use resources from off-planet, and we will have manufacturing capability in space, and we will build things that we cannot realistically send up from the Earth. I'm personally enthused about space stations, and lunar mining colonies, and anything that can expand our human presence out there... but just as important is the next generation of pure science endeavors, robot probes of our larger world, big delicate contraptions assembled beyond the hellride of exiting our atmosphere, sent out on years' long twisty journeys by ion drive and solar sail, spreading our virtual presence to make this solar neighborhood *ours.*

Happy New Year! I'm drunk; can you tell?"
33,2012-01-01 07:03:59,"I come from a family of financial fuck-ups; my parents never budgeted, credit card companies rejected them, mother embezzled from her company and got us all kicked out of our home when I was seventeen. In the nine years since then, I've made several fuck-up mistakes with my money, all due to a general lack of personal finance wisdom. However, I credit myself with learning from each failure. My husband and I now live in a nice house, and each month my budgeting and savings skills improve.

Long story short: I've worked very, VERY hard for every cent I earned, and I did it without (and often despite!) my family.  But when I have enough to spare, the first place I plan on investing is in my younger siblings.  I want to create opportunities for them to make their own mistakes, and learn from them, without endangering their livelihoods. That safety is a luxury I never had.

So as I read your story, I put myself in your sister's position.  What would I do, if one of my siblings made huge mistakes, and hid them from me? To be honest, I'd want to find out about it sooner, rather than later.  I'd want to know that my money wasn't wasted. In other words, if I couldn't get my cars back, I'd want to know my brother or sister bought something else with that investment; knowledge / wisdom / the kind of experience that prevents you from repeating past mistakes.  

Here's my recommendation to you, friend, as a big sister who feels responsible for her siblings:

1. You made several huge mistakes. One of those was repeating your huge mistakes, and hoping they'd resolve themselves.  Make an honest list of your errors.
1. Using your list of errors, identify what you learned from each snafu.  Be real about it; if you didn't learn anything, don't make anything up.
1. Next, figure out what you'll do NEXT TIME you run into situations similar to each of the incidents where you made mistakes.  What will you do differently? 
1. Tell your sister the truth.  But show her your list (or whatever portion of it you're comfortable with). Explain that you've learned some hard lessons, but you're willing to take responsibility for the damage you've caused while earning them. Explain that you're grateful for the opportunity she provided to you, and this frank conversation is the first of many steps toward earning back her trust.

By organizing your thoughts ahead of time, you'll feel more in control of the process. When you give her a list of things you learned, you'll be showing you understand the value of her investment, even if you can't repay it immediately. By being honest with her, you'll be demonstrating that you're willing to do the hard work it will take to get back on track, and get yourself through school.

I mean this sincerely: If my brother or sister informed me they poorly managed a huge sum of money and hid it from me in a desire to cope, I'd just be happy they were OK, and trusted me enough to tell me something was wrong.  Sure, I might be pissed about losing the money, and being lied to, but at the end of the day, they're FAMILY.  If your sister decides to never speak to you again after you go through the effort of the steps listed above, then she probably won't be a healthy source of support while you work to put your life back together. 

Besides; SHE'S the one who gave a large lump sum to a young and inexperienced sibling, and then FAILED TO FOLLOW UP on the course of said investment. She could (and should!) have helped you along, and made sure things were turning out OK.  I'm sure she thought it was a sign of trust, but you never want to throw a new kid in the deep end like that, unless you're prepared to deal with the damage they can do while they learn to swim. In a way, this whole situation is the fallout from HER mistake, when she handed money over to you, but didn't follow up with guidance.

Tl,dr; Figure out what you learned from all this, and tell your sister what's up.  If she's a good sister, she'll still love you - either way, you deserve to move on and be happy.

Good luck. "

35,2012-01-01 12:57:50,"I agree, largely with your observations. The Bush administration however, pushed VERY hard on the Iraqi leadership and ultimately would have found some concessions to maintain based ""in country"", Mr. Obama's administration specifically made no serious effort in that regard. There were a total of 4-5 pro-forma meetings but never the kind of pressure the Bush/Cheney folks were pushing. 

And for me I think THAT's the difference, Mr. Obama was and probably remains, capable of defusing the psychotic/[delusional](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuJ9eanBDOM) mentality of the neoconservatives, in what can be initially perceived as some new ""white man's burden"", in fact real effect and the neoconservatives real  impetus to my mind, stems almost exclusively from the desire to suppress industrial / technological development in the Levant. Not by disengaging completely but by slowly removing our presence in the region. It serves our interests longer term to do this.

Moreover, this worldview is enhanced and indulged by the alignment of US corporate interests with respect to oil/gas. Mind you this corporatism itself has left the United States totally vulnerable to risks associated with oil supply that other nations, notably [Japan](http://www.oil-price.net/en/articles/japan-seeks-resilient-energy-policy.php), [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China%E2%80%93Iran_relations#Military) ,even [England](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/edmundconway/6505670/North-Sea-oil-is-dragging-us-into-the-red.html) , [Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany) and [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France) have LONG since moved to limit their risk towards oil supply problems. 

More specifically to the point of energy, our corporations have for too many decades, decided simply for reasons of greed, to disregard warning on literally every front, economic [supply &amp; demand](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2563), [industrial/domestic](http://the-end-of-oil.com/), and [military/cultural/international](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4IdWUzrcJM), to say nothing of ""secondary"" warnings that have been blaring for literally 30 years.

In pale comparison, Japan in fact suffered the worst industrial / nuclear accident in human history , and is still pressing forward with developing nuclear power plants (albeit safer models).

A final note would be that would will not by way of comparison find the absolute absence of concern around the idea that Viet Nam is currently working on a [nuclear reactor](http://www.thanhniennews.com/2010/pages/20111202-da-lat-nuclear-reactor-fully-converted-to-low-enriched-uranium.aspx)"

39,2012-01-01 23:05:14,"SAP is an odd animal; it will become clearer when you get more into it.  I'll do my best to explain a bit of it here, but you're going to end up with a wall of text (I apologize in advance, but encourage you to read it all.)  

I wouldn't call SAP bloated, I've seen it used effectively in $100M businesses, and am in the midst of an installation at a $30B company.  It's used in retail, manufacturing, financial and raw materials areas amongst others.  That amount of flexibility and scalability comes with a certain amount of complexity.  

Knowing ABAP is the first step, and like any language, given enough time you can become very well versed in it.  

The density comes in the different functions that SAP incorporates.  these different areas called *modules* serve different business applications.  Some of them are:  

 - SD (Sales and Distribution) for your sales orders and such  
 - MM (Material Management) for your materials/articles 
 - PM (Plant Maintenance) for your Distribution Centers 
 - FI/CO (FInance and COntrolling) for all of your financial stuffs.  

I haven't found a definitive list, but the consensus is that there are 80 or so when they're all added up (including technical ones such as ABAP.)  

Each of these modules will have different applications.  I'll take a simple example:  SD.  Within this module there are a number of functions:  Pricing, discounts, promotions, customer information, terms, but the main thrust of SD is the sales order, so let's look at that.  

The sales order has something called **user exits**, which are used a lot in SAP.  These are things that apply changes automatically in SAP - in this case to the sales order.  One such user exit is for invoicing, so when customer X puts in an order, a paper invoice is created.  Customer Y will get an electronic version and Customer Z gets a Fax (each of these has a program running downstream, which we'll assume has been built and is functioning correctly).  As an ABAPer, you will need to figure out how this user exit works, and how to change it up so when Customer Z purchases anything from *Category 1*, they get a fax AND an email.  For everything else, they only get a Fax.  

To make things more fun, there can be different kinds of orders (or order types):   

 - Fax/phone  
 - Received electronically
 - Entered by sales reps.  

Each of these will have the same user exit, but they may need to function in different ways.  

So this whole wall of text has talked about 1 user exit for 1 module.  According to [this](http://abaplovers.blogspot.com/2008/02/finding-user-exits-in-sap.html) SD has 105, but it's a few years old and that number may have grown.  

So now I can get around to answering your question.  I doubt that there are any people who know SAP end to end.  I've had the luck to work with a guy who has been programming in SAP for about 15 years and he still comes across things he has to research and figure out.  Even the guys that program SAP will have deep knowledge in one area (SD) or a good idea of the overall, but few - if any - will have enough of both to say they know everything there is to know about SAP.  

**Finally** again, sorry for the wall of text.  If you have any other questions, fire away I'll answer them as best I can...even though I don't know it all ;)"
40,2012-01-01 23:55:46,"The international division of labour is a very basic theory within marxism, it functions as the basis for imperialism, and the exploitation of one country by the other, in the same way one class is exploited by the other. Of course I am against exploitation, so it's not alright locally. Marx, Lenin, Immanuel Wallerstein, many theorists (including non-marxist ones) have described this at length.  
This theory is about the division between the Center and the Periphery.
It has nothing to do with an individual's self-sufficiency, it has to do that the value produced by a person in the third world is appropriated by another in the first world. The Nordic bourgeoisie benefits from this kind of system, as it is located in the economic center of capitalism.  
Socialists should be for workers owning their own labour.

Then present a united front to all family members.  If future in laws want to help pay, and have some control, let them have control over something that you are willing to compromise on.  So, if say location is really important to you but perhaps the catering isn't, let FMIL know that you'll be having your wedding in said geographic area, but that you'd love help on picking out catering and have her help you do that.

While I agree with others that if you let her dictate your wedding, she might try to dictate other portions of your life, don't make these conversations about this.  Focus on just this, and don't try to solve every future potential problem.  They might never happen.

44,2012-01-01 14:28:26,"&gt;What kind of company do you work at? (software, bank, hedge fund, etc.)

I spent 3 years at an investment bank, 2 years at a traders and most recently 2 years at a gambling company.

&gt;What is the work environment like?

It varied but as a general rule, IB's are always going to be quite reserved and corporate. That can change if you work near the front desk where getting shouted at is not unusual. Honestly as an industry they are not that different - most are average and some are outstanding. Casual fridays is commonly chinos and a shirt rather than flip flops and board shorts. The gambling industry is way more relaxed and a lot more fun in general.

&gt;Are the people nice?

Some are, some aren't. Finance does tend to attract more than it's fair share of arseholes but if you get the right company you should be fine.

&gt;Quality of life at company? 

Ha! That can vary so much given the nature of the beast. There is more than one reason why finance tends to pay more - they want the best but they also want the best to be available at their beck and call. I don't know of any industry where the 14 hour day death march does not occasionally happen but in finance you sometimes have regulators change their minds or countries change laws in ways that no one could have forseen and the first company to react to it gets the spoils.

Another point to note, it might seem perverse but in finance you will rarely be working on the very latest technologies as the companies tend to prefer proven tech. The number of IB's still using 5 year old (or more!) versions of languages, platforms and application servers would shock you. This is a generalisation however as there are pockets of proper R&amp;D that do things that can only be done with the newer wave stuff."

&gt; how the hell capitalism even works

Please explain to us how capitalism works then.  Doesn't it devolve into a monopoly/power imbalances if not regulated?  The ""99%"" (which is not only a stupid term, but also grossly misunderstood) fight to take money out of politics, which actually has value.  The revolving door of regulation is one of the roots of the problem, not joe schmo not knowing the intricacies of derivatives markets.  

Also, investing money is far more difficult than you would expect (outside of mutual funds I guess).  Stocks are essentially gambles in today's economy, and if you have enough capital to get into real estate, then you have enough not to be worrying about being homeless.     

I agree that liberal arts educations need to stop being funded by the government so much and Americans need to stop shying away from ""harder"" majors, like Medicine, Engineering, Finance, hard sciences, etc, but that is a secondary issue that they are arguing.  "
47,2012-01-01 19:01:52,"Mm. Yes and no.

I am primarily an artist. I've thought of myself as one of those for most of my life. I started experimenting with magic about... Four or five years ago? Somewhere around the time I started smoking weed. A little before I was forty I did much the same thing Morrison has said he's done - I made up a couple dieties and offered myself to them.

And most of my magical acts have involved drawing stuff. In part because it's what I *do* - it's a big part of how I express myself. I tried to shape a certain future by making [a tarot deck](http://egypt.urnash.com/tarot) that was subtly biased to tell certain stories. (Examine ALL your favorite oracles for their agendas, btw. I am sure I am not the only one who's done this; I'm just one who's aware of it and admits it.)

My current project also has some magical themes in it. It's just going to seep in - its something I do, it's something I'm interested in. It's going to color the way I think about doing things for a very long time; when I'm constructing a story, one of the ways I ask myself questions about where it's going and what should happen is to ask myself things like ""which court card or major arcana fits this character best"".

If I'd declared myself A MAGICIAN earlier in life, I wouldn't have art as a mode to express it in. I'd be finding ways to do it. Which might well be art or writing or interpretive dance. Heck, a hobby I picked up after starting to dabble in magic is doing burlesque dance; one of the routines I'm working on is a sexy caricature of summoning my HGA. Or maybe it's me DOING a ritual onstage in the guise of caricature.

And in a way, I HAVE been declaring myself a magician for a long time. The mode of art I trained in is animation. I'm far from the only person to speak of the ""magic"" of still drawings coming to life. After a decade or so becoming disillusioned with the industry I still feel a spark of delight every time I animate something for myself.

But fundamentally I feel that ""magic"" is a thing you can USE the creative arts for, rather than the creative arts themselves. It is a set of techniques for understanding the world and changing it. People like me and Grant who dedicated ourselves to art long before magic will use our art, because that's what we're experts as. If you dedicated yourself to business and finance growing up, then declare yourself a magician, then you'll use THAT because that's what you're skilled at.

What are you skilled at? Use that in your own Great Work."

You can do whatever you want.  It's not about you.  It's about me and me being able to live with myself.  I just can't stand thinking about how much of my hard earned money went to finance this crap.  This shit stops now and stops forever.

49,2012-01-01 20:37:38,"I don't understand how it's valid to excuse a president because the things that deviated from his platform were carried out by his subordinates. The whole premise of his campaign is that he would straighten out the executive branch, shed some daylight on its operations, and stop the kinds of things you've attributed to his subordinates.

And yes, I'm focusing on the promises he broke because egregious affronts to his constituents are more important than the modest successes he argues justify a second term in office. So what about Eric Holder, then? What about his enormous corporate backing with Goldman Sachs in both his campaign finance vanguard as well as his administration? Didn't he pitch the case that he took his orders from the people rather than the corporations?

Furthermore, why would you consider his policy a 'draw-down' if it was intended to leave 50,000 troops behind? That's no small number. Isn't 'training, equipping, and advising' the sort of excuses we always heard in Cold War-era proxy wars like Vietnam? How would repeatedly pushing back the timeline for withdrawal satisfy the electorate's desire to end the war as soon as possible? It's not like 16 months is such a hurried pace that our troops would have been wiped out by the heinous insurgents. Never mind that it's actually been *three years* and only now has occurred because the Iraqis made happen. Presidents only need to take advice from the generals when they're still fighting the war. If the decision is whether to end the war or not, the responsibility is on him. Shifting it to his subordinates is not really exonerating evidence....

When politicians make promises they can't or don't intend to keep, the use a backdoor to seem like they're not reneging. You just have to look past the smokescreen.

53,2012-01-01 23:09:30,"&gt; So, again it is where do you draw the line. Plenty of people believe Soros was able to funnel money to Obama through the internet in amounts less than $100 so the names didn't have to be reported. If the likes of Karl Rove decided to work for a candidate for free and I need to pay for it... The argument could go on forever.

The only thing I'm certain of is there's no perfect answer. No matter what regulations are put in place, I think there will always be people like Soros and Rove who will find some way to game the system, in some way. But I believe (maybe naively) that there has to be ways to limit the amount of manipulation that occurs. 

&gt; FTR - I do believe something has to be done on campaign financing, but I'm just coming up against the First Amendment issue. I've heard people put out a compelling argument about term limits violating the First Amendment.

I hear that, and no regulation limiting one's rights should be taken lightly. But I don't think that a limiting of rights is in argument in itself. We live in a nation of laws, and laws there are aplenty. I wouldn't argue that I should be allowed to punch a man in the face because it's my natural right to swing my arm in any space I want to, nor would I argue it's ok to steal 20$ from a man because that 20$ is how I'm pursuing life, liberty, and happiness. I wouldn't make that argument because obviously violence and theft damage society, and one can make the same case for unregulated campaign finance.     

So maybe people can make a compelling argument for term limits violating the First Amendment (why not be able to vote for a candidate indefinitely if you like his/her policies?), but my response would be, ""So?"". The question people should be asking with regards to term limits (and campaign finance) should be ""Will this result in us getting the kind of government that reflects our will?""

55,2012-01-01 05:55:40,"No problem! After playing your game for just a little bit (It's awfully late here for me so I didn't stay too long), I thought of a couple more specific things. Please don't consider this as a critique, these are friendly ideas and I genuinely think your game is fun! 

Have you thought about adding personal stores in addition to the Auction House? In Anarchy Online (not a MUD, but still a good game), you could set up a clan store or a personal store and stock it with items that were available until sold out. Your clan would add a tax rate. I think you could do this in Kingdom of Loathing also, and people could browse all the stores for ""padded leather"" and find them at various player stores, then they'd often check out their other items for sale.

Instead of having an herb store stocked by the game then, you could have people sell their herbs to a clan store, or even sell their herbs directly to the herbalist after they gather the herbs from mob drops or wilderness scavenging (maybe a class feature?)

I wasn't sure if there were areas other than the Necropolis and the Wilderness. What about adding other areas that have unique creatures? Instead of the Wilderness, how about the Underdark or the Caves where you'd run into similarly generated yet terrain-appropriate critters?

I really like the Assassins guild and the functionality of the Necropolis town. The raffle feature is a good way to encourage lots of activity too. Very cool stuff. So since your game seems heavily finance-based (taxes, banks, etc) can you use your money to invest in businesses or trade commodities between villages? If a certain village is having a famine this week, maybe they will pay 25% more for wheat, or something like that.

In a way, your game reminds me a little bit of Kingdom of Loathing. You have a lot of strong guild elements and those are great. Like name_was_taken suggested -- crafting would be an awesome addition. In KoL, you could craft a lot of unique stuff with hidden recipes (or at least not well known recipes) and sell them on the auction house for tons. That was really a popular feature. 

Sorry if I'm rambling or if this was way more than you wanted, I'm a bit tipsy from New Year's celebration and I love text based games so I get a little excitable. Your game is pretty fun, especially if you are involved in a clan, I'd wager. I sincerely wish your game well -- there aren't that many surviving multi-player text games left, and it's great to see a good one in action. =)"

It's fascinating how complex finance is and how far removed we are becoming from ""traditional"" banking where banks just lend capital for growth. Even though I aim to profit from the financial system as it is, its value to society seems to be decreasing rapidly. It almost feels like there are increasingly fewer opportunities to invest in, and financiers are struggling to come up with opportunities to throw money at to profit from. Hence banks increasing leverage to chase after smaller profits, and also sell-side analysts on the airwaves continuously spouting how there will be 10% growth and dramatically overestimating ""price targets"". The system as it works seems to need growth when there is almost no empirical source of it. "
58,2012-01-01 13:14:19,"The relationship is this: ALL car dealers, new or used, hammer on monthly payments. The next time you go buy a car from a lot, ask for the finance rate, they will almost certainly dodge the question while trying to make you happy about the monthly payment. Also, they can negotiate the price of the vehicle if you use the ""in-house"" fiance company on at least new vehicles. The finance company usually provides the dealership with cash incentives to finance with them, thus the dealership can ""make up"" for the loss in the price via interest and incentive cash from the finance company.

Edit: By example, if you wanted $1500 off the price, the finance manger can push the payments from 60 to 72 months with a slightly higher interest rate. Thus, your monthly payment goes down and the dealership profits rise. People are so brainwashed that you need a new car every 3 years that all they care about is the monthly payments. "

70,2012-01-01 15:39:04,"Thanks!

Ok, I'll break down a few points.  

* 
An individual can go into business for themselves, and this is called a sole-proprietorship.  This means that if there are any charges, any legal action or any bills that come due, the individual is responsible for it.  A lot of photographers, artists and other people in the creative community operate this way.  The issue lies in that they have no ""protection"", in that if they are sued, their personal assets are also considered fair game, so they could go after their car, their house, their bank accounts, etc.  So many small businesses go and become an LLC. As far as politics is concerned, they are limited in their contributions by the existing caps, depending on the campaign (congressional, county, state, federal, etc, often around $1500 or so, but it varies).

* 
An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is essentially very similar to a sole proprietorship, except their assets are considered separate from the individuals involved.  They have different accounts, pay out a payroll, and most importantly, taxes separate from the individuals involved. It's a company in name only.  There has to be at least one person involved, they have to have a yearly ""meeting"" with minutes, and essentially, they are ""protected"" in the sense that if someone sues or bills the LLC, they cannot go after the owners assets.  Doing so is called ""piercing the corporate veil"", which is exceptionally difficult to do because the plaintiff has to prove that the individual acted alone and out of accordance to the company's best interests.  Examples of doing so are things like Kenneth Lay and the Enron assclowns.  Most restaurants and small businesses are LLC's.

* An S Corp is your big companies.  They're your manufacturing, services, retail, etc.  They have a big payroll, are either public or private, but cannot have more than 100 shareholders.  Now this is important, because corporations are considered people, a 501c(3) can actually be a shareholder of a corporation.  It's gets a little muddy there.  The other things to note is that the share holders have to file their taxes separately, based upon whether there is a profit or loss on the shares.  They are ""protected"" just as with an LLC, and a ""C Corp"" (not previously mentioned, but differ from S's in that they pay their own taxes - many C Corps are now offshore to avoid this).

* Now, a 501 (c) is a non-profit organization or association.  They can range anywhere from your local food bank to Citizens United (Douchebags That They Are).  Without going too much into it, a 501(c) is one of many different tax-exempt companies, which you can read [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501%28c%29).  The key thing to read is that that 501 (c)(3)'s cannot contribute to anything political, or risk losing their charter.  However, they can be shareholders, and... we come fullcircle again.  Back to corporations being given rights that exceed those of individuals.

* A very important note here, is that 501(c)(4)'s like Citizens United (The Douchebags That They Are), are **NOT REQUIRED** to disclose who their donors are.  They are not limited in how much a donor can contribute.  So insert your favorite shadowy influence here...


* Then there are the ""527's"" - or Political Committees.  You know them as ""MoveOn.org"" and ""Swiftboat Veterans For Truth"", as well as a few others.  They're not all evil, but they exist for a very specific purpose, and that is political influence.

* All this is important because the previous versions of McCain Feingold (or Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002) set limits of how much a ""company"" (which would include 501c's) can spend out of it's budget on campaign related issues.  The standard was set as ""no more than 50%.""  With BCFRA being essentially overturned, it meant that a company, ANY company, could spend its ENTIRE budget on campaign related things, like commercials, attack ads, newspaper ""articles"", and of course, lobbying.

* The question arises, would an LLC, or an C Corp spend it's entire budget on political influence?  Of course not, yet they operate under the same protections and rules as 527's, and 501 (c)'s do.

72,2012-01-01 19:00:46,"During 2011 (and sort of 2010) I realized that many things (in society) have already happened at some previous time in history, recent history even. Our collective memory is just really shitty, so we resort to reinventing the wheel or setting us up for an identical crapfest regularly.

For example: When the finance crisis hit and action was needed to deal with the banks, people were discussing whether they should be nationalized or not. ""SOCIALISM!"" was heard chanted, and also Sweden's swift bank bailout in the early 1990s was sometimes used as a (successful) example of nationalization during a crisis (I think 10ish key banks were nationalized within 10ish days. BAM!). IRONICALLY this ""action model"" was based on shit that went down and dealt with in a banking crisis in.... wait for it.... TEXAS in 1983!!!

Lets pause here for a second and look at this:
* Texas - In my eyes as a European the representation of anything opposite of socialism, at least value-wise.
* 1983! - It's not like it was dinosaur material. Its just a couple of (2.5) decades ago! Yet - afaik not exactly frequently brought up in journalistic analysis, but I am just going with gut feeling here, I wasnt exactly scanning the media, but watched and read a lot :)

There seems to be a book about the Texas events btw:
http://books.google.se/books?id=DaIEl3w5EbMC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;ots=L3vVU8Gv3I&amp;dq=texas%20nationalization%20of%20banks%201970s&amp;hl=sv&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20nationalization%20of%20banks%201970s&amp;f=false

I have become increasingly concerned by the fact that we as humans seem to never learn from our mistakes. I feel that a lot of things we do are so inefficient..

And while I am at it btw, many Americans use the word socialism when they really mean communism.

Sit down with your finance and talk about what kind of wedding the two of you want to have. Make a list of elements that the two of you want to include in your wedding. Try to prioritize them. If you feel like it, also make a list of stuff you absolutely do NOT want to be part of your wedding.

Have that conversation and make that list NOW, before you look at bridal magazines or go to a wedding show, or, God forbid, let your mothers get involved.

Getting married is about the two of you making a commitment to each other and sharing that moment with the people close to you. That's the important thing. 

In five years, nobody will care about what kinds of flowers were in the bouquets, what material the bridesmaid's dresses were made of, whether there was quiche at the reception, etc. Don't let the wedding marketing machine con you into thinking that you ""need"" to have expensive things you don't really want, and don't let the wedding planning process snowball into a nuclear stress bomb."

Did she completely RANDOMLY ask you about Cecily Brown? You could probably say ""I didn't know who Cecily Brown was until you mentioned her, but I looked her up and liked a couple of her paintings. A lot of them seem both warm and chaotic at the same time. Weirdly awesome.""

I would ignore the rest of the crap about her dying silk. She says that women and men are two different species. That sounds like a shit test to me which can be ignored.

And what's this ""Tough Mudder?"" An event you are passionate about training or watching? Whatever I guess you can ignore that, too. Unless you want to connect the emotion of you training for that event OR doing improv theater to the emotions she feels while creating, to show understanding and a common interest. She loves being creative/expressive. So say something about how in the same way she dedicates herself to expressing things through a stationary medium, you do it through a living one, aka yourself. But don't sound that smart, boring. 

respond briefly with something cute and interesting about finance/improv theater. Improv theater is far more interesting than finance. escalate for a meet in person to continue the discussion.

K so your message as a whole should look something like this...only five or 6 sentences.

""I didn't know who Cecily Brown was until you mentioned her, but I looked her up and liked a couple of her paintings. A lot of them seem both warm and chaotic at the same time. Weirdly awesome. I respect anyone who is creative. Improv theater requires a lot of creativity, too, and what I like about it is that my tool/brush/medium of expression is my physical self, so I can learn more about myself and depth as a person and have it loop into my acting. Also, at our meetings we tend to laugh a lot, which is a plus.

I think I'd like to talk more in person. We could meet at Grumpy's if you'd like, that seems fitting. Thoughts?

Cheers,

I see where your coming from but you cannot hope to change the current system unless you participate in it and the only way to participate is to take one of the two established parties and push them to embrace reform.

81,2012-01-01 23:08:44,"I'm in Canada where the finance process is different, but from what I understand, there's a sliding scale at most dealerships based on credit score.  When the manufacturer advertises 0% or 2.9%, etc... financing, it's based on having a decent credit score.
But if you have poorer credit, that number can increase.
The dealer is going to sell the car at the same price regardless, but the amount of the monthly payment will change depending on your credit score.  So, my ""best"" price (which in reality is asking for my best ""payment"" is based on credit score.  Top notch credit will get a lower payment.
I've put people into 29% interest rates, and those people were happy just to get approved.  I've had plenty of people that I've had to tell that there's no way I can give them  a car due to their bad credit."
82,2012-01-01 23:28:16,"No deal is a deal until all parties agree on it.  Before they draw up the bill of sale, they will find out exactly how you plan on paying for it, whether it be cash, or a predetermined finance ($x down, at Y amount of months).
The salesman generally doesn't get paid on finance kickback (we call it ""reserve""), the business manager and sales manager might (depending on the situation).  With manufacturer financing, there is no reserve when you take the subvented rates (ie: 0%, etc...)
Sometimes there are actual cash incentives.  You're shooting yourself in the fott if you aren't upfront and honest.  You may be losing out.
I don't understand why consumers feel they have to be dishonest in order to feel that they are getting a good deal."

It would be far more mechanically simple as well as lighter and more efficient. 

In telecommunications: circuit-switched data. Enough already. 

In finance: Prepaid credit cards that pretend to be debit cards. Sooner or later the United States and South Korea are going to realize that they've made a terrible, terrible mistake and begin working to the Interac standard like everybody else in the world. 

In Marketing: Television commercials are becoming less and less effective. I can see them disappearing entirely. 

In professional audio: analog cables, except for dynamic mics in a performance environment. Already there is a digital protocol that connects with a modified XLR cable, and there are boom mics that output digitally. Mics with digital output are becoming cheaper than ever and could soon replace the older methods entirely. Patching between equipment could be done with SPDIF, hopefully using light-pipes.

91,2012-01-01 15:33:41,"They way we did it was 20% downpayment and 3x thousands for monthly, meaning a $10k car was $300/mo for 60 months. I usually subtracted the downpayment first, so a $10k car would be $2k down and $10k-2k = 8k *3 = $240/mo. That's a total of $16,400 if you do the math (240*60 + 2000). That's probably a bit high if you have good credit but may actually be a little low if you have really bad credit. 

Remember, you have to add in tax, licensing, registration, etc as well as finance charges.

I would definitely go in with at least a quote from your bank as to what kind of financing rate you can get. The dealership will try to beat it, and hey, more money saved for you if they do, but then you can figure out what your payments roughly should look like. 

Sometimes they'll actually sell a car for too much money and then they'll have to try to ""hide"" it. Let's say you agreed to $2k down and $240/mo. but you have good credit and your payment is more like $200/mo. Now they've got an extra ~$2k that they either need to use to sell you stuff or drop your payment - but since you're OK with $240 they'd prefer to sell you more stuff. That was another guy's job, to sell stuff like window tint and other accessories and HEY - look at this - they can do it and keep your payment the same!

Ultimately it all has to add up and the finance guy should go over how much you're paying and what it all goes towards and how much you're paying overall in the end. You'll sign a contract with it explained to the penny. They may do a ""close"" where they just say ""sign this"" but you have a right to look over it and ask questions about anything you want explained. A good finance guy will go over everything so you come out comfortable and happy but that's not always the case."

Again black and white thinking.  This logic is just if it's not 100% free market then it's fascism.  That is a very false choice.  There are many points in between the two.

 &gt;Wrong. If the government simply got out of the fiat currency market, these banks would be forced to give bonuses based on profitability. As it stands now, the banks are simply waiting for their state issued welfare check to roll in with no concern for profit margin.

&gt;After all, if you have a guaranteed safety net, you can take as many risks and partake in as much bad behavior as you want without consequence. 

  You only show the downside of a safety net.  Using the example of SS as a safety net what would happen if there was none?  How many people would be in the streets eating cat food after they get to the age where no company wants to hire them?

How about unemployment insurance?  How fast would a majority of people see pay of $1 an hour?   How many more people would be out in the streets?

After all, they are the most profitable corporations in the world, and have helped make our conventional approach to health become the statistical leading cause of death in the US.  http://www.webdc.com/pdfs/deathbymedicine.pdf

I'm not questioning your heart when you put forward such a genuine effort to help people, but you need more complete information.  "

95,2012-01-01 18:39:03,"The 'complex' instruments have existed since the beginning of finance.  The only difference is that they were regulated out of existence for the very reasons why we screwed up by deregulating them back into existence.  Also, the finance industry accounts for about 50% of all the domestic corporate profits.  Now, does this really make sense?  Seems like this could only be explained by some kind of fraud or mis-pricing of assets - which is what happened."
96,2012-01-01 20:24:32,"February is going to be a very bad month for the NDP. A budget is always a time when eyes are on Commons, and if the article is correct, this one will be especially noteworthy. The Liberals will have just returned from a convention, perhaps with renewed energy - and the NDP will be caught up entirely in its own leadership contest, which might have the NDP looking either like a party with a leadership drought or like a party bogged down in factions and infighting. Either way, neither Turmel nor Peter Julian will be up to the task of effectively opposing Flaherty's cuts, so all the soundbites will go to Rae.

Imagine if, say, Peggy Nash (either as Finance critic or as leader of the opposition) was leading the charge against Flaherty. As it is, she'll be occupied elsewhere and will have nothing to say against Flaherty. 

It's a *big* missed opportunity for the party, and one that it might take months to recover from.

97,2012-01-01 22:01:36,"Here's an example for you:  There are over 72,000 PAGES of US Federal tax code.  Today, 40,000 new laws went into effect across the country.  There is no way any person can know and understand all those laws, and yet they are required to comply with them.  If you pick a bunch of IRS and private tax attorneys the same tax scenario, they will come up with almost as many different answers as tax attorneys.

The problem with that is that rule of law becomes irrelevant:  You can always find some law being broken by anyone you want to go after.  It transforms our country of laws into rule by men - flawed and biased and self-serving, like all men are.

This environment attracts corruption - it exists and the power and money in Washington is a magnet for it.  There is always some way around any rule you try to put in place, and the incentives for the bad actors and those they can compromise are too great.  And with the size and complexity of that huge bureaucracy, virtually everyone is corrupt or compromised.  What incentive does an honest politician have.  If they have a large number of truly grassroots people behind them, they will do the right thing, but most of the time that's impossible, and they just go along to get along.

""Campaign finance reform"" is simply a protection racket for the incumbents.  Every round of it tried so far has demonstrated that clearly.  You would have to completely dismantle the system of largess that the establishment feeds on.  Only Ron Paul has a plan for doing that, which is why the establishment is so afraid of him.

Many of the good deals out there are only available to cash buyers, though.

&gt; Otherwise, if you're determined to pay cash, then your dad is right. 

What explains all the foreign investment in property down in Florida right now then? Billionaires from countries like Brazil and Russia are buying up all the foreclosed property they can find down in Florida. Obviously they think real estate is an amazing deal in Florida right now...

Edit: I mean, doesn't it make sense to buy in housing markets that have been hit the hardest? They also have the most room for appreciation. I can't see the value of Florida homes dropping *much* more than the -85% we've already seen. I can definitely see a ""second wave"" of foreclosures pushing home values *way* below the current -15% we've seen in Massachusetts, New York, and California. Am I completely crazy in my thinking? I don't see foreign investors rushing to grab up property in California or New York, but they're all over the property in Florida."
99,2012-01-01 23:43:48,"Because most credit card companies charge 1.8-3% usage fee to the dealer, we will only take a maximum of $2000 towards a vehicle purchase on a credit card, otherwise it will eat too much into our profits.
If the loan is open, and there is no penalty for paying it off early, you may be able to get a bit more of a break if the dealer is willing to give you some of their finance reserve.  But if there are any costs involved, it probably isn't worth it to you."
