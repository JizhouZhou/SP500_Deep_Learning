0,2017-01-01 08:37:29,Those Brexit changes in full,"There's been a lot of concern lately about the changes Brexit may bring here's a handy guide to what's currently ~~planned~~ scribbled on the back of a menu from Chequers: 

**Every Day:**

All land further than 25 miles out to sea, as measured from Dover, shall be renamed as ""The Edge of the World"" and the Channel tunnel will be renamed ""Gateway to Hades"". The F&amp;CO will be renamed ""The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; There be Dragons Office"" and will issue appropriate warnings against foreign travel for those not already aware of the inherent dangers. 

Airports will be required to anglicise their destinations to make travellers feel safer, examples include Amsterdam-on-Sea, Paris-Sodbury, Berlinton, Prague St Aldwyn’s, Vienna-on-Trent, Warsawcombe, and Berningham.   

Due to copyright restrictions the 23 June will not be known as ""Independence Day"" but ""Fuck You Germany"" day in line with similar holidays planned in Poland, Russia, and Hungary. 

Greggs will become the great national bakers and their branches will replace artisan bakers, patisseries, especially Patisserie Valerie, and any other producer of high quality baked goods. Baguettes, croissants and eccles cakes will be the banned, the latter purely because it sounds a bit foreign. French stick will be named ""Nigel"", in celebration of how the shape reminds us all of Lord Farage. 

The twinning of cities, towns and villages is to cease. Instead those arrangements already in place will be changed to evil siblinging, eg: Dover has the evil siblings of Calais, Split and Huber Heights.  

**Weights and Measures:**

Metric will be abandoned as will Imperial measures in favour of the medieval tradition of weighing everything in blocks of lard. two hundred and twelve blocks of lard will be known as a ""fatty"", and two and one half ""fatties"" make a ""morbid"". Thirteen ""morbids"" make a ""fuckmethat'sheavy"" three and eight forty sevenths of which make a ""mahoosive"". 

Percentages will be replaced by selected fractions. Everything under 48% will now be zero, anything above will be expressed in halves, fourteenths, forty-sevenths while algebra will see ""x"" replaced by A50. 

Kilometres will become ""Kontinental Metres"" inferior as they are to a British mile and the exchange rate will replace the sterling exchange rate for stability. 

**Immigration &amp; Free Movement:** 

Immigrants will be expected to dress in their stereotypical costumes in the style of old Two Ronnies sketches for the duration of their stay, the French in horizontally striped shirt, berets and carrying a string of onions, Germans in Wehrmacht uniform with a beach towel, the Hollish in clogs, a silly hat and where a dyke isn't available they should carry a recreational amount of cannabis. Where national stereotypes aren't clear you should refer to the forthcoming guidelines from the new Minister of Immigration; Jim Davidson. 

To dispel any notions of foreigners, herein ""forrin'"", continuing to enjoy free movement they will be required to walk everywhere sideways bar narrow gaps where they must hop. Travelling backwards is still reserved for British citizens. 

International students will be required to spend fourteen hours a day in bed to ensure they align to the British standard already in place. 

**Finance:** 

Decimal currency will be abandoned in favour of £sd which will be aligned to the national basic wage scheme envisioned to better increase economic equity across the UK, namely:

*Politicians will be paid in guineas
*The upper-class shall be paid in pounds
*The middle-class shall be paid in shillings
*The working-class shall be paid in pennies

Some may have been confused by a mistyped claim prior to the referendum vote, to clarify we can solidly state that £2.50 a week more will be paid to the NHS. 

So it's not as bad as you may have thought - here's to a great 1957. "

It started with Reagan and they gained power under Bill Clinton. The American governement has been taken over by an oligarchy.",

3,2017-01-01 21:40:10,"How To Scale Your Service To $100k+/Year Whilst ""Nomading"" (Part I of III)","I’ve been a bit slack with work over the festive season so thought I’d get back into the swing of things by posting something that will be valuable to a lot of people here.

For full disclosure, this is NOT going to work for everyone. You’ll need a skill of some kind. There’s nobody out there getting paid to dick around in foreign countries without bringing something valuable to the table so if you don’t have something in your locker that saves people a headache then go acquire that.

Here I just want to highlight the exact steps involved with getting paid handsomely whilst you travel and what you really need to be focusing on.

One of my big nuances with “how to be a nomad” content on the whole is that it really distracts from the key fundamentals to being able to work and travel.

I’m not saying you can’t make money by writing a blog, creating shit loads of content every week and then bending over backwards to get traffic from social media because you can - I just think that’s a really long way round and the people that sell stuff on “make money whilst you travel” usually only make their money from selling the dream so I’m offering an alternative way to do things.

First things first…

The fact that you want your income stream to offer you the freedom to travel should be a consideration but not a driving force.

The question “how do I make enough to work and travel?” isn’t the one you need to be asking.

“How can I take a headache away from someone?”

That’s your starting point.

The money and lifestyle aspect I’ve always considered a nice side effect of taking headaches away from business owners.

They have a problem. I solve it. That’s the transaction.

So if you’re a programmer, your client might be fed up with fly by night freelancers who never hit deadlines. If you’re a copywriter, your clients will be sick to death of managing their email database. If you’re a consultant, your client is frustrated by the fact his business does “X” sales but should do “Y”.

One of the easiest ways to keep your earnings low is to constantly think about yourself. For a while I only ever thought about ME. How much can I charge to make this vacation possible, how quickly can I do $10k in sales because Thailand is boring me senseless. 

The second I put prospective clients needs ahead of my own, I was quickly able to up my rates and work with people who were far better to deal with and that comes to understanding how to speak the clients language.

A few weeks back I was trying to hire a web developer to integrate a survey funnel into one of my websites and the first couple of guys I spoke too pitched themselves on the basis they knew all kinds of technical stuff inside out.

That pitch might work on some people but talking to me about whether to use “CSS or HTML5” is fucking useless as I don’t give a shit. I just needed the survey funnel to work.

To cut a long story short, the third web developer got on the phone and said “Give me a few hours and I’ll have this working perfectly with ActiveCampaign”.

Done. He said he’d solve my problem fast. He got the job. He was charging 3x what the first guy was asking and I bet he makes a great living handling these kind of tasks for people like myself who can barely install WordPress.

This is why understanding your ideal client and knowing exactly what they want is so important.

Nobody wants a copywriter. Nobody wants a programmer. Nobody wants a web developer.

We want solutions to problems. You’re being hired for an outcome.

Don’t sell something, solve something.

There’s tons of people that can write a great 1,000 word article for $50 but people aren’t buying content for the sake of it.

They need credibility, traffic, subscribers, buyers, appointments, affiliate sales etc so that same 1,000 word article can be sold for $500 if it’s pitched in a way that speaks to the desired outcome the client wants.

Same can be said for programming, web development, conversion optimization, funnel building, consulting etc.

If you have a skill in the B2B space, chances are your prospects are losing money/missing out on sales without your input so sell it that way.

Remember: When you’re pitching to a client, their interest is FORWARD MOVING. 

What you’ve done before doesn’t have a massive affect on whether you’ll get hired in a lot of cases if you’re speaking your ideal clients language.

And the easiest way to do that is to develop a robust ideal client avatar.

You don’t want to be all things to all people as you’ll face an immense battle to sell each prospect so niche selection is really important.
As a copywriter, I could theoretically write for most businesses and add value but clients come a lot easier when you go after one niche. Here’s why:

It’s competitive out there. There’s plenty of people who can do what you can do (in most cases) so when you come into a situation where you’re looking to land a client and you present your portfolio of 10 different projects immediately you’re going to be treated as a commodity that can be easily replaced. You’re a mongrel.

Now, if your portfolio has 10 projects that are incredibly similar to the market your prospective client is in you’re going to win that contract a lot of the time. You’re a pedigree.

Put yourself in the shoes in a business owners who’s involved in say, finance…

You’ve got one guy who’s an email marketer in weight loss, travel, finance, personal development, dating and a few other niches.

And you’ve got one guy who only works in the finance niche.

He understands that market. He’s got 10 examples of work in the finance niche. You get on the phone with him and he has the know-how of your employees because he’s a specialist.

You would choose the guy with the track record in finance all day long.

And assuming he presents himself in a way that solves a problem, he can command a much higher fee too.

When you only work in one market, you naturally end up with a portfolio that nobody can compete with and as you’re “the pedigree” you don’t need to compete with anyone on price.

That and the fact that your own efforts to land more clients can be hyper-targeted make this an offing-simple way to start landing more work/better paid work almost immediately.

To develop your “ideal client avatar” I recommend creating a doc and answering these questions (there’s other ways to do it but this is how Dan Kennedy originally taught it way back and it’s still effective today):

1. What keeps them awake at night, indigestion boiling up their esophagus, eyes open, staring at the ceiling?
2. What are they afraid of?
3. What are they angry about? Who are they angry at?
4. What are their top three daily frustrations?
5. What trends are occurring and will occur in their business or lives?
6. What do they secretly, ardently desire most?
7. Is there a built-in bias to the way they make decisions? (Example: engineers = exceptionally analytical.)
8. Do they have their own language?
9. Who else is selling something similar to them, and how?
10. Who else has tried selling them something similar, and how has that effort failed?
As most of us will be in the B2B space, I’d also make a point to understand what my ideal clients earnings are.

I generally only like to deal with business owners making over $100k+ but less than $500k as they’re the ones that most benefit, can afford what I offer and they’re generally accessible.

I’m sure there are good candidates below and above those thresholds but this is about creating a profile of who you’d work with in an ideal world.

Once you have that you can then shift your marketing over to problem/solution and tailor all your communications/content to them.

BIG TAKEAWAYS

SOLVE SOMETHING, DON’T SELL SOMETHING, KNOW ONE MARKET INSIDE OUT, BE A PEDIGREE, DON’T BE A MONGREL.

In Part II, I’ll talk about the quickest way to interact with quality prospects at zero cost (I hated spending money on advertising) and in Part III I’ll talk about pricing and closing.

#SPARKY 101

I’d like to thank MasterPlum for his great guide on Sparky, which inspired me to write one as well. [The Problem with Sparky: A deck building guide for the swingiest card in Clash Royale]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4qyz76/the_problem_with_sparky_a_deck_building_guide_for/).

Background: I got the Sparky at about 2600 trophies in early June, and I used a Sparky deck to climb into Legendary Arena.

My high is 4000 trophies, and I’m currently at ~3900. I'm currently running the [Sparknado](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/5dt2a2/legendary_3900_sparknado_deck_guide_sparky/?st=IWJPE4N8&amp;sh=014d560c) deck.

Sparky: The most offensive, annoying, and fun card to play in the game, but also one of the easiest to counter. In this guide, I’m going to detail how to best use Sparky, and how to win with her.

Why Sparky is **great** (and my favorite card):
* Huge damage, if you can get her locked on the tower

* Very punishing if you make a slight mistake

* Great as a supporting troop

* Forces opponents to respond

* Psychologically intimidating, the mere sight of her can cause opponents to panic

* Great on defense against any type of tank

* Dynamic (if you are behind, you can easily come back in **one** push)

Why Sparky is **difficult**:

* Easy to counter and lose your elixir advantage from it (Zap, Valk, Guards, Dark Prince, Gobs + Skeletons, Mini Pekka, Barbarians, Fire Spirits…)

* High cost for potentially no gain

* Doesn’t defend against air

* Charge time means she is very vulnerable on opponent’s turf after one shot

Sparky is a very well-balanced card because there are almost more cons to playing her than pros. There is no getting around the fact that Sparky is hard to play. However, if you can master her (and I certainly haven’t lol), then you can win consistently.

*Tips on playing Sparky:*

**Never lead with Sparky**

Because of how easy she is to counter, I don’t recommend playing her as your first card. The caveat to this is, if you are in a lower Arena (5,6,7), then you can probably get away with this because your opponent won’t know what to do, he’ll hesitate, lose elixir, and then go full defense mode, letting you dictate the match. Once you get into Arena 8 and 9, never start with Sparky.

**If your opponent plays a tank (Giant, Pekka, Golem), play Sparky in your backfield to take out his tank**

It takes Sparky 2-3 shots to take down any tank, and even if your opponent has a zap ready, their tank won’t make it to your tower if you distract it with a building or troop in the middle. Sparky will keep firing at their tank, leaving you time to deal with support troops and build up an offensive push. Starting with Sparky on defense then transitioning to offense is the best way to use her.

**If your opponent plays the Royal Giant, don’t respond with Sparky**

Because of how fast the RG will target your tower, it will take Sparky too long to charge up, fire, then charge up again, and take out the RG. Don’t treat Sparky as a counter to the RG because you’ll lose about 800-1000 HP on your tower. You’ll need to pack another counter, like Mini Pekka, to deal with the Royal Giant.

**Protect Sparky as much as you can**

The longer you’re able to keep Sparky alive, the more shots she gets off. The more shots she takes translates into more wasted elixir for your opponent or more health off of their tower. If you can keep Sparky alive and get her to get off a lot of shots, you’re golden. 

You definitely need Sparky to be behind some sort of tank, such as the Giant, Royal Giant, Golem, Pekka, Valkyrie, Bowler, or Baby Dragon. I haven’t seen any Lavahound/Sparky decks, but you can certainly try.

**Support Sparky with splash damage troops, like Wizard, Princess, Bomber, Fire Spirits, and Furnace**

Some of the most popular counters to Sparky are Zap + cheap troops to finish her off. Using splash damage on support will prevent these cheap troops from finishing her, which keeps Sparky alive longer. 

*Here are my fast, simple tips to building a Sparky deck*

**You need a back-up plan:**

Sparky is so easy to counter, even if you play her perfectly you may only get 1 shot on the opponent’s tower in the entire game. You’ll need another way to get damage on their tower that doesn’t rely on Sparky.

**Based on your backup plan, pick a tank to protect Sparky.**

Pick a tank you are familiar with first, and go with that while you learn the deck. I’ve used RG/Sparky and Valk/Sparky personally, but Giant/Sparky is very popular, and Pekka/Sparky and Golem/Sparky could be effective, too (although expensive).

**Pick supporting troops that do splash damage**

**Add in a defensive structure to district tanks with**

This will give you time to drop other counters to your opponent’s tanks. You don’t need to pack an inferno tower because Sparky will take out the really big tanks like Golem and Pekka. One building I would suggest is the Furnace, because it will distract tanks, including RG and hog, and it will also be able to support your Sparky on a push.

**Add a counter to RG or Hog**

These two cards are the hardest to deal with using a Sparky deck. Hog cycle decks can rapidly get in and do damage, which prevents you from taking the time to build up a big Sparky push. RG will lock onto the tower so fast you can’t rely on Sparky to counter, as talked about earlier.

**Plan on how YOU would counter your own deck, or how you would counter a Sparky deck with your deck**

This will make you think through your deck choices, and it’ll also get you ready when you face another Sparky deck. My tip for facing Sparkies is to get your own Sparky down as often as possible and to face the enemy Sparky on your own side of the river.

Let me know if you have any questions, and I will do my best to answer them! I've also had rbot comment the stats of Sparky in the comments below.

#SPARKY 201

A few weeks ago, I published [Sparky 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4rg8a1/strategylegendary_sparky_101_a_comprehensive_guide/) where I laid out the basics of using Sparky and building a deck around her. In this guide, I’m going to discuss the best uses of Sparky so you win as often as possible. 

**How an average Sparky battle progresses:**

    1. **Let your opponent make the opening move**

You **never** want to open with Sparky. Because of how many counters there are to Sparky, as well as the fact that your opponent will have full elixir, this will almost always result in a negative elixir trade.

You want to start the game by **assessing what strategy your opponent is playing**, as this will determine how you play Sparky.

    2. **Get a pump down early (but don’t leave yourself low on elixir)**

You’ll want a pump going to finance your huge Sparky pushes. However, because of the expensive push cards (Tank and Sparky), you may not have great options for defense in your hand. If you play an aggressive pump and your opponent pushes, you could be caught off-guard. Be ready to defend, if you play an Elixir Collector.

    3. **Spend the first 45-60 seconds (it goes fast) of the battle watching how they play**

My personal preference with Sparky is to get a sense of what my opponent is playing before I drop her. I like to understand their playstyle before I start a risky push.

The result of this strategy is that you will lose HP off your tower in the first part of the battle. This is completely normal with a Sparky deck, and you can easily make a comeback in **one** push.

     4.**However, there are times when you can play Sparky early**

I will play Sparky early in these conditions:

1.	My opponent drops a huge tank, such as Pekka, Giant, or Golem:

a.	Sparky’s high damage means Sparky + ice wiz or MP is the **best** option to deal with these high HP tanks. This can also force my opponent to use a zap on my side of the map, which is better than on their side of the map. If you defend well, you can then drop a Giant in front of Sparky and they might not have the elixir to defend.

2. My opponent drops their own Sparky

a.	The **best** defense against a Sparky is your own Sparky. If you can play it right and blow up their own Sparky with yours surviving, you are almost guaranteed a tower down. You’ll want to zap use Zap/MP/Ice Wiz/Goblin Barrel to defuse and destroy their Sparky while yours deals with the tank in front.

3. My opponent drops a Lavahound

a.	The Sparky decks I run are pretty weak to air, so these battles turn into base races for me, generally. If I can pressure the opposite lane with a Giant/Sparky push, my opponent doesn’t have the elixir to support their Lavahound, which allows me to only have to deal with a hound.

       5.**Once you know what your opponent is playing, defend your low-health tower with Sparky pushes**

This is my favorite part of the battle. Your first Sparky push has the greatest potential for damage (because it is a **surprise**), so be sure to do a full push with supporting troops. 

Drop Sparky in the very back of your side so she has time to fully charge by the time she gets to the bridge. You **do not** want an uncharged Sparky at the bridge.

Don’t go overboard on the first push if you aren’t in double elixir because you need to be able to 1) respond to what your opponent does on their side of the map and 2) defend their counter push. 

By sending pushes up the lane of your low-health tower, you force your opponent to deal with your push before they can go for damage on your tower. This can often result in you taking their tower and they aren’t able to get any more damage on your tower.

	6. **As the game progresses, continue to drop Sparky in the very back**
This is what I call the **Pain Train**. By continuing to drop Sparkies in the backfield, you keep the pressure on your opponent while simultaneously defending your tower.

Your opponent has no time to build an offensive push because they are so busy dealing with Sparky, and you may take their tower down from Giant damage alone.

      7.**Use the mantra: *One push, one Sparky* **

Dual Sparkies can be **very** dangerous. With 2 charges, you can deal with any threat. However, it’s costly to set-up and one zap can allow your opponent to destroy both Sparkies. 

If you ever try this, do it in double elixir for a 3-crown attempt.

I suggest using this very sparingly. One Sparky is more than enough to take a tower down. Using 2 allows your opponent to gain a **huge** elixir advantage and take down your towers, instead of the other way around.

    8. **You don’t have to be continually pumping, but you want to be pumping while Sparky pushing**

Because of the high push-cost, a pump helps you to put together a killer push. However, the high cost also means you don’t always have a lot of elixir to defend with (another reason why your tower health will go down early). You have to be smart when you play a pump. Wait for full elixir before you play it, with nothing coming at you from your opponent.

I said earlier to wait until your opponent has made some pushes before starting the **Pain Train** (Sparky pushes). I will start my pushes when I’ve defended a push or two from my opponent, started a pump in the back, and have 10 elixir. 

If there’s a pump down and you’ve seen a few pushes from your opponent, you can definitely start a push. If you want to play a little **risky**, you can even drop a Sparky if you just have a pump down (and haven’t seen any opponent pushes yet).

    9. **Play Sparky decks patiently**

You can’t be aggressive with Sparky because of 1) the high push cost and 2) the low-cost counters. You need to have some sort of tank in front of Sparky for any push, and you also need supporting troops.

Sparky pushes take time to build, so be patient with it. Unlike other decks, you only need **one** good push to take a tower, so make **each** push count.

     10. **What decks Sparky is good against, and what decks Sparky is weak to**

Sparky is very **strong** against:

* Pekka-Double Prince

a.	Assuming you can protect Sparky and get shots on the Pekka, Sparky will counter the Pekka quickly and for an elixir advantage. If you can get a shot on the double princes, you almost guaranteed yourself a free tower on the ensuing push. 

* Hog cycle

a.	Hogs are easy to defend against: MP/Ice Wiz or MP/building, etc. Once you get your Sparky down, you can even 1-shot hogs on your side of the map. You can stop hogs from taking your tower in the early game and follow up with strong Sparky pushes.

* Golem decks

a.	Sparky can decimate Golems with **3.2** shots (and Golemites in 1), gaining you a net elixir advantage and low tower damage. You won’t struggle against these.

Sparky is **weak** against:

* Air decks

a.	I don’t carry Musketeer in my main Sparky deck, so I’m weak to Lavahound decks. As I said earlier, I push the opposite lane with Sparky to prevent my opponent from supporting their Lavahound.

* Giant-Loon

a.	The lack of Musketeer makes me weak to Loon, and Sparky is not a good counter. Sparky takes time to charge up, so if you play Sparky as they play their Giant, your tower is done because Sparky can’t charge up **2.7** shots in time. You’ll need a counter to **Giant/Royal Giant** beyond Sparky in your deck.

Sparky can be **OK or not** against:

* Miner decks

a.	I generally beat Miner cycle decks, but it depends on your opponent. Between zap and the miner, your opponent can discharge plenty of Sparky shots to keep her off their tower. It comes down to skill rather than any innate counters.

* 3 Musketeer decks

a.	I struggle against 3 muskie decks mainly because I don’t run fireball. They can use 3 musketeers along with a Zap to take out my Giant then my Sparky, which is a positive trade for them. It’s hard to defend a tower from 3 Musketeers, so I often go down 2-1 with a loss.

* Royal Giant decks

a.	Once you get the **Pain Train** (Sparky Pushes) rolling, Royal Giants go down pretty quickly (in **2** shots). In the early game, they can definitely be difficult. You will want another counter to the RG beyond Sparky.

* Sparky decks

a. It really comes down to skill here. If you're able to handle the opponent's Sparky well, then you can easily win. But if you make a mistake, you'll generally lose. It takes a lot of practice and knowing which plays to make when.

Just today, I zapped the opponent's Sparky at the wrong moment and lost the game; I also played well against one and 3 crowned them.

#SPARKY 301

#NOTE: This was written before the August 24th, 2016 balancing changes that nerfed the duration of Zap. See [this](https://redd.it/4z0zyd) update summary of how Zap will change the recommended actions from this guide.

Hey what’s up guys, it’s MWolverine (#GoBlue) back at it again with another Sparky guide.

This is Part 3. In this guide, I’m going to focus on the interactions of Sparky with other troops. Different *situations* call for different uses of Sparky, based upon your opponent’s plays. A huge aspect of this is about timing, especially managing Sparky’s charge and your opponent’s zapping.

Special thanks to theDauntingZx and TenaciousT (also from colorado fury) who helped me with all this testing!

Without further ado, let’s get into it.

#TL;DR:

**Defensive Situations:**

* Sparky vs. Large Groups of High HP troops
* Sparky vs. Unexpected Push
* Sparky vs. Single High HP Troop
* Sparky vs. Rocket

**Offensive Situations:**

* Sparky vs. cheap ground troops and Zap *
* Sparky vs. mini-tanks
* Sparky vs. Minion Horde 
* Sparky vs. Minions *
* Sparky vs. Mini Pekka and Zap
* Sparky and Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka and Zap *
* Sparky and Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Wizard, and Zap *
* Sparky and Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Spirit, and Zap
* Sparky and Ice Spirit vs. Mini Pekka and Zap
* Sparky and Ice Spirit vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Wizard, and Zap *
* Sparky and Ice Spirit OR Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Spirit, and Zap
* Sparky vs. Barbarians and Zap
* Sparky vs. Freeze

Sparky’s high DPS splash damage is perfect for taking out large groups of high HP units. For example, barbarians or Hog + Goblins. Let’s look at [Image 1](http://imgur.com/a/wV2Mi). Other good examples of this are [Image 2](http://imgur.com/a/XHPY3) and [Image 3](http://imgur.com/a/nr0F7).

* Situation:

We have barbarians followed by fire spirits (7 elixir), in Image 1. In Image 2, your opponent has dropped Giant and Barbarians on top of each other (10 elixir). In Image 3, your opponent has dropped Miner and Mini Pekka with Minion Horde and Ice Wizard behind.

* Response:

For 6, Sparky will annihilate all of them, while in the back field. However, your opponent could use zap, so you should be ready to drop a distracting troop while Sparky re-charges.

* Analysis:

This situation is a great use of Sparky. Sparky, on defense, can chew through big pushes with ease. Your opponent can risk a zap, but then they are exposed on your counter-push, so they don’t have a lot of great options. If you can keep a charged Sparky in your backfield, your defense is tough to get through.

* Pro Tip: Once you have defended a few pushes, always try to keep a charged Sparky in your backfield. This will pressure your opponent and stop them from making big pushes.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Unexpected Push**

Sparky, because of her charge time, is not a good response to an unexpected push, such as the one in [Image 4](http://imgur.com/a/gtzvA).

* Situation:

Your opponent has played RG, Bowler, Miner, and Ice Wizard (18 elixir).

* Response:

It’s really tempting to drop Sparky. She can take out the supporting troops and some of the RG’s health in 5 seconds. However, the ice wizard will increase her charging time and the Bowler may get damage. It takes Sparky 2 shots to take out the RG, and he will get at least 1200 damage in that time (10 seconds charging + 1 deploy). 

This means you can’t drop Sparky here. The best response is to drop splash damage and defensive troops (building, Mini Pekka, or Musketeer) to clean up the push.

* Analysis:

Sparky, because of her charging time, can’t be used as a response to unexpected pushes (i.e. RG). She’s great on defense, but she has to be dropped pre-emptively. 

* Pro Tip: If you want to use Sparky on defense, try to predict when your opponent will start pushing and place a Sparky in the back to begin charging. If your opponent doesn’t push, you can push yourself with Sparky. If he does, he’ll have to contend with a full-charged Sparky.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Single High HP Troop**

Sparky is an OK response to a single high HP troop, such as PEKKA or Golem, as seen in [Image 5](http://imgur.com/a/RyfKs). 

* Situation:

Your opponent has played PEKKA or Golem in the far back of the map.

* Response:

You *can* drop Sparky and have it handle this situation. It *will* work against the tank, and your opponent is prevented from dropping any melee support troops (except ranged ones, such as archers or spear goblins) without getting annihilated by Sparky. However, Mini Pekka has a higher DPS than Sparky.

Against Golems, because they only target buildings, I really like dropping Sparky. Sparky will take care of the golem while you can focus on the supporting troops.

Against PEKKAs, I prefer Mini Pekka because it’ll handle her in less time. If the PEKKA gets onto Sparky, you’re toast. It’s less of a risk to drop the Mini Pekka, but I find myself resorting to the **Tank and Spank** most often (seen in [Image 6](http://imgur.com/a/YYdMd)). That’s where you absorb the PEKKA hits with a tank and destroy it with Mini Pekka *or* Sparky.

* Analysis:

I like Mini Pekka for PEKKAs simply because there’s less risk for a bad trade and more upside. However, Sparky can definitely work, you just need to keep the PEKKA from getting onto Sparky. Both are great options for Golem, but I do prefer Sparky. If you have a bad rotation, don’t stress about dropping one or the other to deal with a huge tank.

* Pro Tip: If your opponent drops Golem in the back, wait a few seconds then drop Sparky so she is fully changed to meet the Golem on your side of the map. If your opponent drops PEKKA, protect either Sparky or Mini Pekka with swarms or a tank.

* [Bonus](http://imgur.com/a/8vYUh): Don’t drop Mini Pekka with your PEKKA when facing Sparky

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Rocket**

One of the rare hard-counters to Sparky is the rocket, coming down in [Image 8](http://imgur.com/a/EM9w0). Your opponent can drop it on Sparky and the tower, making a really good trade.

* Situation:

A Rocket on Sparky can go one of two ways. In [Image 9](http://imgur.com/a/UKCHn), the rocket completely destroys Sparky and gets free damage on your tower. In [Image 10](http://imgur.com/a/xAFC8), the Rocket is not a tourney levels (level 7), and Sparky survives with a sliver of health. 

* Response:

If the Rocket destroys Sparky, you shouldn’t play Sparky again unless they play Rocket first.

If the Rocket doesn’t destroy Sparky, push hard.

* Analysis:

If Sparky is gone, you can’t play Sparky again. There’s nowhere you can drop Sparky away from your tower so she is fully charged when she reaches the river—and if Sparky isn’t fully changed, she can’t protect your tank from countering troops and your opponent doesn’t have to zap Sparky before taking her out.

If Sparky survives, your opponent just wasted 6 elixir to damage your tower, but Sparky is still alive and can still get shots off. That’s makes a really dangerous situation for your opponent. They can zap her down, of course, if they carry zap, but then they’ve wasted 8 elixir on a 6 elixir threat with the rest of your push still intact. It’s a bad situation for them.

* Pro Tip: If your opponent plays Rocket early, before you’ve played Sparky, commit to a big push right away because you don’t know if you’ll get the chance to get Sparky out again.

-----------------------------

#Offensive Situations

The biggest risks to Sparky on offense are clean-up troops and spells that affect her charging time:

* Ground troops
* Air troops
* Ice Spirit
* Ice Wizard
* Freeze Spell
* Zap Spell

**Sparky vs. cheap ground troops and Zap**

A common way to deal with Sparky is to zap her then drop low-cost high DPS troops, such as goblins. Alternatively, a shot can be wasted with skeletons then goblins can be dropped. I’ve shown this in [Image 11](http://imgur.com/a/GntXt).

* Situation: 

Your opponent has zapped Sparky and then dropped goblins or cheap ground troop on her. 

* Response:

With cheap ground troops, zap them, drop fire spirits, arrow them, etc.

* Analysis:

These troops are very vulnerable to any type of spell. If you have the extra elixir, you can easily keep Sparky alive. This forces your opponent to respond again, with Sparky’s charge nearly full this time. It’s great for you, bad for them.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. mini-tanks**

Another way to defuse Sparky’s charge is to drop a mini-tank, such as Valkyrie (because at tourney levels, Sparky doesn’t one-shot Valkyrie). You can see this in [Image 12](http://imgur.com/a/ShONg).

* Situation:

Your opponent drops Valkyrie to defuse a Sparky shot to buy time and/or take her out with cheap ground troops.

* Response:

Since it takes 1.00000001 shots for Sparky to take out a Valkyrie, send in troops to do the final 248 damage to take her out, at tourney levels.

* Analysis:

If you drop a spell, you’ll have to use fireball to clean her out—arrows leaves Valk with 5 HP. Fire Spirits are great, Princess is another option, really any clean up troops are good. Even if your opponent zaps Sparky first, you’ll want to get damage on the Valkyrie so Sparky only takes 1 shot.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Minion Horde**

One common counter to Sparky is the Minion Horde. Immune from damage from Sparky, Minion Horde doesn’t even require the use of zap. You can see it in use in [Image 13](http://imgur.com/a/9oge6).

* Situation:

As soon as Sparky crosses the bridge, your opponent drops Minion Horde right on top of Sparky.

* Response:

There are two types of responses: preventative and responsive.

Preventative responses:

* Wizard
* Furnace
* Princess

Reactive responses:

* Fire Spirits
* Zap
* Arrows
* Freeze

If you don’t have ready splash damage, **don’t zap Minion Horde**.

* Analysis:

Minion Horde is so rapid at tearing through Sparky that you need to expect it to counter it well. That’s why you see Wizard so often with Sparky, because he is good at stopping Minion Hordes. Often, the first time I see Minion Horde I am not ready to counter it—but I am the second time. 

The best response is to wait for your opponent to zap Sparky (or drop counter troops), then drop Fire Spirits at the bridge. Because Fire Spirits can be zapped, **don’t drop them before your opponent either drops Minion Horde or zaps Sparky**.

Another good response is to zap the Minion Horde, if you have Princess up. One zap + one Princess shot will annihilate a Minion Horde.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Minions**

Another common response to Sparky is Minions, but it isn’t as effective as Minion Horde. Here it is in [Image 14](http://imgur.com/a/iI1W2).

* Situation:

Your opponent drops Minions on top of Sparky as soon as she crosses the bridge.

* Response:

If you have any type of anti-air with Sparky, use it. Minions are so slow at destroying Sparky that they can be easily countered.

**Zap Minions so you have even more time to deal with them.**

* Analysis:

Because minions have half the DPS of Minion Horde, you have time to work around them. With Minion Horde, you have to react instantly or Sparky is gone. With Minions, you have twice the time to take them out (and half the units to take out). Thus, you can zap and have enough time left over to save Sparky.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Mini Pekka and Zap**

The most common response to Sparky is to zap then drop Mini Pekka, as shown in [Image 15](http://imgur.com/a/fMPhz).

* Situation:

Your opponent zaps Sparky then drops Mini Pekka at the bridge.

* Response:

At this point, you can’t do anything. The Mini Pekka will take out Sparky with 2 shots before she can get a shot off.

**Don’t zap the Mini Pekka; even if you zap her, she will still destroy Sparky.**

* Analysis:

Mini Pekka has such high DPS that it will destroy Sparky in 3.8 seconds. Even if you zap the Mini Pekka, she will only need 4.8 seconds to destroy Sparky. It’s close, but you can’t ever win the race (because Sparky takes 5 seconds to charge).

-----------------------------

**Sparky and Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka and Zap**

You can support Sparky with an Ice Wizard to slow down your opponent’s Mini Pekka. It changes the math! Take a look at [Image 16](http://imgur.com/a/uGlEf).

* Situation:

Your opponent zaps Sparky then drops Mini Pekka. You’re supporting Sparky with Ice Wizard.

* Response:

Ice Wizard will slow Mini Pekka *just* enough to let you get a shot off, if you **zap** the Mini Pekka. 

* Analysis:

This will put you ahead because Mini Pekka won’t destroy Sparky. However, Mini Pekka will get 1 out of 2 hits on Sparky, so you will take damage. Your opponent has just spent 4 elixir to take out Sparky, and you’ve spent 2 (5 if you count the initial Ice Wizard). They’ll still have to handle Sparky somehow, and this often takes them by surprise.

-----------------------------

**Sparky and Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Wizard, and Zap**

This scenario is very similar to the one above, so it’ll be pretty short. You can see this situation in [Image 17](http://imgur.com/a/O8E6P).

* Situation:

Your opponent zaps Sparky, drops Mini Pekka and Ice Wizard. You’ve got Ice Wizard on support for Sparky.

* Response:

Same as above. If you **zap** the Mini Pekka, your Sparky will survive, but it will take 1 Mini Pekka hit.

* Analysis:

I’m not sure on the numbers here, but I know that the Red Ice Wizard doesn’t add enough time to Sparky’s charge to prevent her from getting a shot off. If anyone knows the percentage slow that Ice Wizard applies and could help here, please leave a comment!

-----------------------------

**Sparky and Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Spirit, and Zap**

Ice Spirit is rarely seen currently, but it’s worse than zap because the freeze duration is twice as long (2 seconds). You can see this in [Image 18](http://imgur.com/a/MIBAe).

* Situation:

Your opponent zaps Sparky (because she would shoot the Ice Spirit first otherwise) then drops Ice Spirit and Mini Pekka. 

* Response:

There’s nothing you can do. Sparky is basically out for 3 seconds, and it takes Mini Pekka 3.8 seconds to take out Sparky without any interference. **Don’t zap the Mini Pekka.**

* Analysis:

At the end of the day, you can’t do anything here to prevent Sparky being taken out. Even with an Ice Wizard slowing the Mini Pekka, Sparky simply can’t charge up fast enough after 3 seconds down to get a shot off before the Mini Pekka takes 2.

-----------------------------

**Sparky and Ice Spirit vs. Mini Pekka and Zap**

In this case, you support Sparky with the Ice Spirit—not as common as Sparky with Ice Wizard, but just as dangerous. You can see it in [Image 19](http://imgur.com/a/Bl76x).

* Situation:

You are supporting Sparky with the Ice Spirit, and you opponent drops zap then Mini Pekka.

* Response:

You don’t have to do anything other than drop the Ice Spirit.

* Analysis:

At tourney levels, Ice Spirit can’t be zapped down, so you can even drop it early (but I’d keep it a surprise). Ice Spirit will freeze the MP for 2 seconds, enough time for Sparky to charge and take out the Mini Pekka before it takes its second shot.

-----------------------------

**Sparky and Ice Spirit vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Wizard, and Zap**

In this case, your opponent is playing using Zap, Mini Pekka, and Ice Wizard. You’re supporting your Sparky with Ice Spirit, as seen in [Image 20](http://imgur.com/a/A1nKc).

* Situation:

You drop Sparky and Ice Spirit, and your opponent zaps, then drops Mini Pekka, then drops Ice Wizard.

* Response:

**Zap the Mini Pekka.**

* Analysis:

I was surprised by this, but Mini Pekka plus Ice Wizard on Sparky will stop Sparky from getting a shot off, even if the Ice Spirit freezes the Mini Pekka for 2 seconds. However, if you zap the Pekka, Sparky has *just* enough time to get a shot off. 

-----------------------------

**Sparky and Ice Spirit OR Ice Wizard vs. Mini Pekka, Ice Spirit, and Zap**

This is a bit of an edge case, but I included it for reference in [Image 21](http://imgur.com/a/tq1NN).

* Situation;

Your opponent zaps Sparky and drops Mini Pekka then Ice Spirit. You have Ice Spirit or Ice Wizard on defense. 

* Response:

**Don’t zap the Mini Pekka**.

* Analysis:

If you both play Ice Spirit, it’s like your opponent only used Zap. As a result, the Mini Pekka will take out Sparky before she can get a shot off.

If you have Ice Wizard on support, your opponent’s Ice Spirit will create a longer effect, which means the Mini Pekka will still win the race.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Barbarians and Zap**

Whew, we finally made it through all the Ice Wizard/Ice Spirit combinations. This is a more rare counter to Sparky and harder to execute. To decrease the risk (if barbs aren’t placed correctly and are all in *front* of Sparky rather than *around*), normally Zap is included. You can see this in [Image 22](http://imgur.com/a/9OrJZ).

* Situation:

Your opponent drops zap then surrounds Sparky with barbs.

* Response:

If you just have Zap, **don’t use it**. 

However, if you have Zap and Fire Spirits, use them. Zap and Fire Spirits will take out barbs at tourney levels, so you can catch some/all of the barbarians and Sparky could survive.

* Analysis:

If you just use Zap, you slow the barbs down, but all four hitting Sparky will take her out before she gets a shot off. Even if she does get a shot off, she won’t get all four barbarians. There isn’t a good way to get around barbarians, if they are played correctly.

-----------------------------

**Sparky vs. Freeze**

This is seen less often because Freeze isn’t in the meta, but it is a really tough combo to get around. You can see why in [Image 23](http://imgur.com/a/PvHme).

* Situation:

You have Sparky fully charged, and your opponent drops Freeze on her.

* Response:

You will have to play something else on defense, or try to put down something like fire spirits outside the Freeze radius to try to protect Sparky. Unfortunately, there isn’t anything you can really do.

* Analysis:

At tourney levels, a Freeze spell will last for 4.9 seconds. It will reset Sparky’s charge, so you then add on another 5 seconds, so Sparky is useless for 9.9 seconds. In that time, your opponent will almost definitely take Sparky out. If I see a Freeze, I don’t play Sparky again that match.

Maybe shoot up a gay nightclub like the last muslim.  Or a charity event.  Or steal the election.   Oh wait no those last two were Russians.  I think...erk!  So much terror to keep track of!

As Obama continues to pass crazy amounts of legislation that the MSM won't cover, stuff that destroys rights, ensures widespread state sponsored terrorism in the form of domestic hacking and intrusion without cause into our computer systems (mass surveillance), (while NOT securing their own non-security systems and agencies like the FDA), making deals to open fracking, to suppress information, to help finance and agribiz sector and all the really terrible things we'd have set Nixon on fire at the stake for decades ago, we'll possibly be seeing lots of false flags, outbursts, movements, angriness, triggering, etc in the media as a way to distract you from it.

He's ""putting English on it too"", spinning the world up in turmoil on purpose to leave Trump with a burning bag of shit on his doorstep come Jan 20th so he can stomp it out and clean up the mess.

What will this mess look like?  Race riots, nonstop civil unrest.  The UN will come in and then it's one-world government time as these distractions cause our infrastructure to be attacked and the dollar to implode.  

There is a reason that China is buying up bitcoin and boosting it to all time highs.

Putin warned us months ago ""you're being distracted""

At any rate, Obama knows at this point he'll go down in history as the most two-faced president who burned us to the ground.  And that's why he doesn't care anymore.  He has been given his instructions to do the most harm to Trump as he possibly can

But this isn't about Trump.  Trump will be fine.  No matter what.

This is about us. 

This is about what Obama is DOING TO US.

It's always been this way.

10,2017-01-01 21:15:11,About to be a 1%er - questions/comments re: my investment + saving plan,"Hi everyone,

i'm 31 years old and just about to finish my medical residency. I've been reading non-stop about personal finance and investing in the last 2 years anticipating the huge jump with my earnings going from ~70K pre-tax as a lowly resident to a 1%er salary, which frankly makes me nervous and I don't want to mess this up like other docs. Here's the current situation:

Debt:
- Student LOC from bank: 180K at 2.7%

Salary starting July 2017:

- $270K post-tax (EDIT: this is via salary, not billings)

- This accounts for a 7.5% contribution matched by employer's 15% towards a pension (rural doc benefits!)

Contribution room:

- TFSA $93 K (including spouse's)

- RRSP: ~$50 K

My investment/debt repayment/savings plan for the first several years is as follows: 

- Live off at most 60-120K i.e. at my current lifestyle, meaning worst case scenario I will have $150K post-tax to invest/save

- Keep an asset allocation of 100% equities. I have read extensively into this and feel this is a manageable risk allocation for me, especially with the pension plan.

- Asset allocation: 38% US ETFs, 30% Canadian ETFs, 25% International ETFs, 7% emerging markets.

US ETFs: prioritize VTI in RRSPs, then bleed over to TFSA with VUN. I won't have much more RRSP room due to the pension, so this will eventually bleed into HXS in my taxable account.

Canadian: VCN in TFSAs, bleed into HXT in taxable.

International: VIU in TFSAs, then eventually take up 100% of the tax-sheltered room since there is no swap-based international ETFs. Continue to hold VIU as it bleeds into taxable.

Emerging markets: VEE in TFSA then taxable.

Within the 1-2 years I will prioritize maxing out my RRSP contributions, then paying off my LOC. This is definitely more psychological than economical but overall I can't wait to get this debt off my back. I'll then take the remainder and put it towards my TFSA. After the first 3+ years I imagine that all my registered accounts will be holding VIU and VEE. My taxable account will hold HXT, HXS, VIU, and VEE... unless they come out with an international swap ETF.

Questions:

1. Can you guys please comment on/critique my plan above?

2. With yearly investments of $150-210K+, would it be advantageous to find an advisor at some point, or should I continue to DIY, considering the possible returns on advisor accessible funds etc.?

Thanks in advance!

**Prologue**

A dark alleyway. A shot rings out, then another and another. Thomas and Martha Wayne lie dead on the street and their son, Bruce, runs into the night. But this is not the world you know - there are no Wayne billions and no butler to raise young Bruce Wayne. Surviving the streets, Bruce travels the world, learning and growing, before returning to Gotham to fix the corruption that had taken hold of the one great city. 

At night Bruce is the Batman, a vigilante fighting the criminals of Gotham, by day Bruce Wayne runs Wayne Enterprises, a growing technology company that is rapidly expanding worldwide. Both Bruce and the Batman face significant challenges and both with require allies if they are to succeed. 

***


The Gotham Applied Physics Research Laboratory was dark, lit only by the few monitors that spilled blue light across the lab benches and neutronium ato-scopes that were dotted around the room. Through the long windows that lined the far wall, I could see out, across Gotham, its skyline picked out in the lights on in many windows, a pristine coating of snow hiding the filth that lurked underneath.  
 
In the darkest corner of the room I had pulled the shadows around me, wrapping myself into a space where the cameras did not sweep and the sensors did not reach. I toggled through the frequencies on the communicators and in turn each station replied; Barbara and Jason on the roof above, Dick waiting in position across the street and outside Renee Montoya, from the GCPD Major Crimes Unit and a reluctant partner tonight.
 
Further away, wrapped up tightly against the cold, Selina sat on a rooftop acting as lookout, trying to give even a few moment’s warning. The party was ready; it was just a matter of waiting for the guest of honour to arrive.
 
Midnight was long past, but patience was key. Three laboratories had been hit in six nights and every analysis had showed that this laboratory would be next and tonight would fit the profile perfectly. Gordon had been reluctant to sit back, the pressure on the GCPD to protect such high profile targets was intense, but he had agreed to let me handle it… this time. If I didn’t get them tonight then there were no more targets in Gotham that fit their profile and it would become more difficult. Tonight was the night.
 
The minutes ticking past slowly and the silence began to feel oppressive. I slowed my breathing and let my mind slip into a light meditative trance but a slight click brought me back to the room and then Selina’s voice whispered into my ear. “They’re here.”
 
My eyes moved to the window and for a moment there was nothing, until something flickered. A small yellow light danced through the buildings, flitting through the sky like a firefly, but it moved faster than any insect could hope to match and it was heading directly towards where I was waiting. A confirmation came from Barbara and then a moment later Dick saw it too; our guest was on their way.  
 
For a moment I thought it must be a wingsuit, but the movement was too erratic, bobbing up and down with incredibly manoeuvrability as it skimmed around buildings, avoiding open spaces until forced to flit across them. The firefly was doing their best to be seen, but with two major thefts of highly processed nuclear material in the last week, they had my attention, whether or not they wanted it.
 
At last they reached the window and I could see the outline, frames against the city behind them. The firefly seemed to have constructed a suit of some sort, made perhaps from a mixture of motorbike leathers and repurposed body armour, it gave a slightly bulky appearance, but was presumably effective at protecting them against the bitter Gotham night. A black hooded mask, with wide lenses for the eyes, covered their face, preventing any sign of the person inside from being seen.
 
Two stubby wings poked a foot or so out from a metallic pod that was strapped to their back and at last I could see that the yellow glow was pulsing from the bottom of the pod. It was almost as if it was some sort of exhaust, but there was no visible trail or sign of disturbed air. Instead they hung, as if suspended by strings from above, simply ignoring gravity.
 
Pulling back a short distance from the glass, the firefly reached back to the pod and pulled some sort of tubing free, holding it forward while turning their head. The blast protection on my cowl’s lenses suddenly darkened as an intense flash was emitted and I was forced to flick the lenses up as they refused to lighten again once the light had faded.
 
The firefly moved forward, into the room and a faint thrumming pulsated from the pod on their back. Where the windows had been, a huge section had simply disintegrated, the edges had melted and fallen away. Whatever the weapon was, it was capable of incredible bursts of heat. Belatedly the fire alarm now sounded and the figure looked up, then moved quickly, hovering forward and across the room until they arrived at the far side. They reached the entrance to the vault and dropped to the floor. As they landed the glow faded away and they staggered for a moment, before straightening and moving to the vault computer.
 
I moved, uncurling myself from the darkness and dropping to the floor, then gliding towards them, staying in the darkness as I moved. The blaring alarm covered any sound I might make but they were fixated on the computer, typing furiously and ignoring all else around them. In moments I was behind them. Without pausing I let loose a bolas; rope and weights wrapping around them, binding their arms and hands to their sides.

They let loose a muffled cry and toppled to the ground and I was on top of them, finally able to see the mask more clearly. It was custom made, crudely adapted from a gas mask. The eyes beneath it were wide in terror as I straddled the figure, reaching down for their hands to bind them securely, while tapping at my wrist to silence the alarms.
 
In the sudden silence I could hear their breath, ragged and scared and a second later I realised my mistake. The throttle for their flight pack was attached to their wrist and with a flash of warning they burst from underneath me and shot forward, throwing me back and slamming into a laboratory bench with enough force to shake loose the bolas.
 
I rolled and came up ready, but they were already on their feet and with a glance towards me, they squeezed the throttle and flew up and back, evading the batarangs that flew from my hand. With astonishing maneuverability they danced back and forth, evading me and moving closer to the window, then darting out of the hole they had made. 


 
“Now.” Jason and Barbara had been waiting and as the firefly emerged, they dropped a net, forcing them to pause in midair as it tangled around them. Dick had been waiting for just such an opportunity and had taken his chance, swinging across on a grapple and tackling them midair and rolling with them into the laboratory once again.
 
Now it was two on one and Dick moved quickly to force the firefly's hand off the controls to their pod. The yellow glow faded away and in moments I had pulled free the tangled net and yanked off the pod, tossing it aside before binding their hands tightly. 

Once secured I pulled the firefly to their knees and stripped off their mask; a mass of light brown hair spilled out and the girl swore and bucked, trying to escape. “Let me go right *now* you fu-” Dick interrupted her by yanking her up further, to her feet. 
 
I picked up the pod and examined it carefully. “Did you build this?” Her mouth opened and closed and then set into a firm line.
 
Dick smiled. “Looks like our lightning bug has gone all silent, Batman.” He shook her. “Either you speak to us, or you speak to the police.” He thought for a moment. “Actually you’ll be speaking to them anyway, but it’d really make life easier if you’d just tell us everything up front and not make us try to work it out.” 
 
She sneered. “Has that ever worked?” 

Dick shrugged. “Gotta be a first time, so that’s a no?” She cocked her head to the side and stared at him. 

I wondered how old she could possibly be, twenty-three, maybe a little older, but not much. Outside the laboratory I could hear the elevators ping – Montoya had become impatient instead of waiting where she was told to. 

She could take the girl, she didn’t seem like the talking type and Gordon would pass along anything useful, but the pack was another matter. It was disappear into the black hole of the GCPD and end up either back on the streets or sold off to someone who’d look to exploit its technology. Until I understood it a little better I decided that it would be coming back with us. 
 
I strode across and took her from Dick, quickly held up a small recording device to her face for a few seconds, pushed the fingers from her right hand onto a pad and then pulled free a few strands of hair, making sure to get a some skin cells, then wrapping it away for later. 
 
I clipped her onto a pipe to keep her in place and then walked to the window, picking up the pod as I went. I could hear Montoya in the hallway, swearing at the night watchman as he scrabbled with his set of keys to let them on. 

Dick looked back at the girl, her face bunched into a mixture of anger and fear. “Last chance to chat with us and not the morons from the GCPD?” She said nothing and he shrugged and we stepped out of the window, fired grapples and disappeared into the night.

“Sir, are you *sure* that you should be doing that in a building crammed full of sleeping children?” Alfred was perched on the edge of a table, sipping at a cup of tea while he watched me work on the pod inside a heavy containment area. He has stationed himself across the room and kept an eye on the geiger counter on the outside of the heavy lead door.  
 
It had taken me three hours to carefully pry the pack open and once inside it had tripped every radiation alarm, until I had moved it to the highest level of containment. For the last hour, Alfred had insisted on watching and wincing each time I opened a new section, occasionally offering unhelpful advice.
 
I carefully unscrewed yet another compartment, whoever had built this seemed to enjoy over engineering, but curiously cared little for the safety of the user. Each motion was difficult in the thick protective suit, but the radiation would be quickly fatal without it. If the girl had fallen or the pod had ruptured somehow… 

“The girl hasn’t said a word to the GCPD, all they can figure out is that she has worked as a research assistant in laboratories all over Gotham. She’s a smart kid, but judging by her grades in school, she’s nowhere near smart enough to invent…” I gestured to the pod. “…any of this. There might be a clue in here somewhere, and if not, then I at least want to know how it works.”
 
With a sigh, Alfred pushed himself from the table and glanced at his watch. “Very well sir, but do remember that you leave for Metropolis in an hour, unless...” he sighed “…you’ve changed your mind?”
 
I paused and pulled back from the pack for a moment. “No, the visit is too important Alfred. We have too many unknowns and when something like this comes along…” I carefully put down my screwdriver and gestured to the complex array of circuitry laid out in front of me. I shook my head “Maybe in Metropolis I can narrow things down a little and find a few answers, instead of yet more questions.”
 
There was a moment’s silence and Alfred looked away. I had seen that expression too many times. “What is it Alfred? Say what you want to say.”
 
He looked like Jason when given as task he disliked. “It’s… sir, we’ve been waging a war in Gotham for years. You’ve effectively made it impossible for the criminals to operate as they had before, so perhaps we should have expected this kind of reaction? Perhaps we should have expected that something would arise to counter you… or someone?”
 
In the depths of the pod, I had finally found what I was looking for: a small almost depleted piece of radioactive material, which I carefully lifted from its housing and moved to a solid lead container. Clipping shut the container I could at last see the radiation sensors beginning to drop, as the levels at last began to normalise.
 
At last I was able to breathe a little more easily, now this could wait until I had more time to do a proper analysis of the technology. “What are you implying Alfred?”
 
He shook his head. “Simply that we should be aware of Newton’s third law, sir, and ensure we are prepared for every eventuality.”
 
The radiation counters dropped to normal background level and I hit the button to open the door and waited as it hissed open and then shut again behind me.  I stripped off my protective helmet and did my best to smile reassuringly. “Being prepared it what I’m best at Alfred.” He seemed convinced and I could only hope that I was as sure as I had sounded.
 
 
 
*****
 
The saloon car moved through the streets of Metropolis easily; great glass buildings towering up on all sides, leading through downtown and towards the largest building of them all, the Luthor tower. It was a gaudy mixture of glass and steel, but effective in what it was intended to do, ensure that every visitor understood that Lex towered over Metropolis in the same way his tower did.
 
The tuxedo itched, partly due to its newness and partly due to the modifications that Selina had added, allowing for quick change into my other suit if required. I did my best not to itch as I rode the elevator up with a crowd of the other guests, most from the world of business or finance. On the other side of the elevator, looking as miserable as I felt, there was one who seemed a little more interesting, Oliver Queen.
 
In the ballroom Lex had gone for his usual aesthetic - gaudy business chic, he’d even had his logo added to a silver curtain that hid part of the stage. I wondered for a moment if I would find little L’s on the toilet paper and then smiled as I saw that the cutlery had an L etched into it.
 
I found my table, after a few moments searching, near the back which was fair, considering my own minor stature and wealth compared to many of the people in the room. The invite, Alfred had guessed, had only been sent as it focussed on the Luthor Orphanage and with the recent publicity surrounding our own, Lex had probably surmised it might get some extra column inches to have me there. 
 
I carefully touched my finger to my ear and a moment later I heard a throat being cleared and Barbara’s voice came through to me. “Uh, ready and receiving.”
 
I slowly turned, as if admiring the room. “Are you ready to do this?” She confirmed and I took out my phone and then flagged down a passing waiter for the wifi password. “Lex1” I confirmed to her and heard a snort in reply.
 
“He really does love his name.”  
 
“Alright, get on it, just remember that you need to be monitoring at the same time, if anything happens…”
 
She sighed. “I know, I know. Your friendly 24/7 Oracle is on the job.”
 
I quickly circled the table and read her out the names of the people I was sitting with. Three business men and their wives, a baseball player and two minor celebrities, no one I cared about and even better, no one who would much care about me.
 
Abandoning the table, I made my way to the bar, watching out for Lex, but he seemed to be waiting to make his own entrance later. On arrival, I found Oliver Queen had already made friends with the barman and I stood beside him and nodded when he looked over.
 
I extended my hand. “Oliver Queen, right?”
 
He looked down at it, then back at me and finally took it and shook. “So they tell me. You must be the infamous Bruce Wayne? I’ve read about you in the papers, Bruce.”
 
I smiled. “I could say the same thing to you.”
 
He lifted his drink. “Touché. So tell me Bruce, are we titans of industry supposed to talk about business at these things? Do we discuss how we squeeze a little more money out of the little guy to fill our stockholders pockets?”
 
I was beginning to warm to Oliver, he was not the man I had expected to meet, considering his family, but then I knew as well as anyone that your family didn’t need to define you. “I wouldn’t know. I don’t have any myself and I’ve yet to make much money at all.”
 
He looked up at me in mild surprise and then gestured to the barman. “Another… and one for Bruce here.” Two glasses of Scotch were deposited, MacAllan, well, at least if nothing else, Lex served decent whisky.” 
 
I took a moment to scan the room and finally saw one of the people I had been looking for, Clark Kent. I took a moment to watch him as he walked beside Lois Lane and the contrast was impressive; she swept forward, her shoulders thrown back and her eyes scanning the crowd constantly. He walked more cautiously, careful not to knock into any of the many waiters of guests who were passing on all sides. 
 
This was the first time I had been able to really observe him and the first time seeing him in person since Dick had returned with all of the information he had gathered while with his cousin, Kara. I stared, hard, trying to see some difference, something off, something *alien* about him, but there was nothing, he just seemed like a normal, rather timid, man.
 
Clark spoke first and I introduced him to Oliver, interested to see what Oliver would make of him, but almost immediately Barbara returned in my ear. “I’m through two layers of security, but whoever Lex has working for him is pretty damn good.”
 
I stepped back and excused myself from the conversation that was starting at the bar, this was more important than socialising and I had a feeling that Clark and I would see each other before I left Metropolis. “Is Watchtower online?”
 
There was a pause. “No, no response.”
 
Damn, this was too important. “Okay, give me a moment, we’ll try to do this together.” I slipped away into the men’s toilet and bolted myself in, ignoring the muffled sounds of banging from the men behind me trying to get in and quickly running through several options with Barbara to try to break down the encryption.
 
After six minutes, I had to concede, it was too difficult to try to do over a comlink in the toilet and we spend a moment adding a few vulnerabilities into the system to allow us entry at a later date. Luthor’s servers were well insulated, but perhaps now, with a link to the inside, we could maybe make some progress hacking them.
 
I moved back out into the ballroom as Luthor finished his speech and began to move back to my table, but Barbara was back. “Uh, there’s something else, while you were talking to that Oliver Queen guy, I kinda hacked his phone through the Bluetooth and right now, well he’s having a weird conversation.”
 
I paused. “Put it through to me.”
 
Oliver’s voice was there, but low and purposeful, greatly changed to how it had been just a few minutes before. “You do have the merchandise I asked for, right?”
 
The other voice was full of sneer. “Of course, what do you take me for? I even have some extras you may be interested in, but we should talk outside.”
 
***

I watched as Green Arrow manhandled a thug, only regretting that I was not close enough to be able to put a tracker on one, or both, of them. Above me Superman silently floated, watching with concern, but Oliver didn’t seem the killer type. I could recognise a good shakedown for information when I saw it and had done the same many times myself. It was interesting though, the kid seemed to have a real talent for it. 
 
A few minutes later both had departed I made my way back inside, taking care to avoid being seen by Lex’s impressive security system. I spoke quietly to Barbara as I made my way out into the Ballroom again.  “Any more luck on Lex’s system?”
 
Her irritation came through clearly, she hated being unable to complete a hack and it was rare that a system could keep her out these days. “No, it’s a brick wall.”
 
“Fine, new job then. Find me everything that you can on Queen Industries and specifically on Oliver.”
 
“Research job? Neat!” There was a pause. “Ooh, he’s pretty.” 

I looked up and saw Lex moving across the room and calculated an interception path. “Hold off the pictures for a moment, it’s showtime, you ready at your end?” I slipped an almost invisible thin mesh patch from my pocket and held it between my fingers.
 
I could hear Barbara typing. “Uh… just getting… yeah, I’m picking the patch up clearly, we’re all set.”
 
As Lex walked, the crowd split in front of him and then reformed behind, like a shark moving across a coral reef. Here and there he paused to say a few words or shake a hand before moving on and occasionally he paused and a staff photographer took a picture. I timed my own path carefully to meet him as he split from another group, picking up an almost finished cocktail from a table as I passed by. I splashed a little on my shirt to make it look like I had spilled some when drinking.
 
I approached from behind and slapped him on the shoulder, slipping the patch onto him and pressing it down firmly. “Got him.” Barbara whispered in my ear. “I have access to all his vitals, ooh this is fun.”
 
He spun at the contact, irritation flashing across his face for a moment before he smoothed his expression again. I plastered a grin on my own face and let my words slur just slightly. “Lex, thanks so much for inviting me.”
 
I extended my hand and he took it and shook with a firm grip. His hand was cool and his pulse a steady sixty-three, I didn’t need a sensor to tell me that, just a few seconds of contact. He let the smallest of smiles flicker at the corner of his mouth and inclined his head slightly. “I hope you’re enjoying yourself Bruce and…” he glanced down.”...that you have enough to drink.” 
 
I looked at my hand, as if surprised by the near empty glass and then handed it off to a passing waiter. “Yes, yes, all very good.”

The photographer approached. “Picture gentlemen?” 

Lex nodded and a moment later the flash went off, almost immediately he glanced behind me and I could feel his attention wander. “I must be…”
 
I stepped across his vision. “So Lex, I wanted to get a chance to chat to you about the processors that we’re building at Wayne Enterprises, we’re honestly setting records for clock rate while utilising a new cooling system that works on the nano-scale to reduce cooling costs by something like three quarters.”
 
He smiled politely. “I’m sure that your prototypes are most impressive, but thankfully my own division is more than capable of providing me with processors that are sufficient for our needs. Anyway, today is about charity, not business and so…”
 
“Ha! *Look* Lex, you’ve no idea what we’re capable of and we’re not just at the prototype stage, we began a production run *yesterday* and we’ll start shipping next week! We had a bit of a set back with the factory being raided, but even that only set us back a few days. Would you believe that guys with guns tried to rob me, I mean who tries to steal from a processor factory?” 
 
Barbara’s voice whispered softly. “No reaction.” I had to push it further.
 
“You heard about the raid, right?”  
 
Lex looked past me and raised an eyebrow an inch, I had almost no time until I was ushered away from him by one of his flunkies. He looked back and this time his smile was wider and slightly cruel. “I saw the footage of you getting out quickly at the start Bruce. Very sensible to keep yourself safe.” 
 
Another whisper from Barbara. “*Still* nothing.”
 
I laughed a little too loudly, as if to ward of the embarrassment. “Not my finest moment.” I could feel a girl at my elbow and took a chance, suddenly moving in closer and dropping my voice. “Apparently one of the men talked so maybe they’ll actually catch whoever did it, that’d be a first for the GCPD, right?”
 
His smile had faded and now Lex simply watched me with something approaching pity. “Indeed, well good luck with that.”  
 
The flunky, a young girl, carefully stepped around me, giving Lex a chance to back away. He nodded his head slightly as he turned away. “Thank you for coming today Bruce.”
 
I pushed past the girl and caught up to Lex in two strides. While almost invisible, the patch would be found quickly by Lex’s security and it wouldn’t take long to work out who it had come from. I had no choice but to reach out and catch him by the shoulder, turning him back to face me while slipping off the patch. This time his face showed real anger, he was not a man accustomed to being moved against his will.
 
“Wait, wait,  hang on a moment Lex. About those processors, so how about I set up a meeting to come talk to you about them, maybe run down their specs with you and give you a little demo? I can promise it’ll beat anything that your boys can whip up.”
 
His voice was now flat, verging on hostile. “I’ll have one of my assistants pass on your request for a meeting to the heads of one of my divisions and they can decide if they would like to meet you. Good*bye* Bruce.”
 
I let myself be led away, back towards the bar and carefully pocketed the sensor patch, breaking free of the flunky a moment later and creating a little space for myself. Barbara sounded like she was trying not to laugh. “I don’t think you’re getting that meeting Bruce.”
 
“Well he wouldn’t take one before today either, but I don’t need another one. I’m guessing there was no reaction from the sensors?”
 
“Nope.” She chuckled. “Well, only what you’d expect to find when someone is annoyed with you.”
 
“There was nothing in his eyes either, he’s either incredibly controlled or he wasn’t involved.” I looked around the room at the party that was still in full swing and let that sit in my mind for a moment. The thugs who had attacked Wayne Enterprises had, of course, said nothing, but my own investigations had shown that at least two of them had been on the payroll of LexCorp years before. Perhaps it really was just a coincidence.
 
“So what are we doing next?”
 
I looked over to see that Lex was making his way towards the elevator and it seemed that Clark Kent had already left, ruling out any chance to speak to him for the moment. It slowly dawned on me that there was no Alfred, no kids and I had a few hours free before leaving to return to Gotham. 
 
I grinned to myself.  “You’ve got your homework, see what you can have waiting for me on Oliver by the time I get back.”
 
“Can do!” Barbara replied chirpily. “Hey, do you think he’s got any powers?”
 
“Right now I just want to know everything I can about him. Start a new file in the index though, he’s interesting enough for that.”
 
I carefully tapped my ear and heard the click as the communicator disconnected, then moved back to the bar, if I was pretending to be drunk then I might as well do my best to keep up appearances and have another drink.

22,2017-01-01 07:35:13,[misc] 10 year plan - is this sound?,"Hi UKPF,

Over the last few months my Wife and I have cleared a bunch of debt, i.e. Car and Loan and got our Emergency Fund at a level that gives me some confidence. In preparation for that I've been coming up with a plan that will cover at least the next 10 years and beyond, some of my decisions are personal, but I was hoping someone with far far more experience then an ex-lurker on UKPF could validate it and make sure there's no glaringly horrible decisions / mistakes in it? 

We've a joint income of £2,862.00 pcm after tax, pensions + student loans.

Bills takes out £936.00 pcm

Leaving £1926.00 to play with pcm.

The plan is to..

Overpay our Mortgage (curr int:2.39, 2 year fixed, ~81,990 left) by £250 a month.  The 10 year part of the plan, is actually this aspect, in that I want to be mortgage free in 10 years. I understand i'll need to pay more in to get the 10 year mark, but that should be doable as I can get pretty good bonus's from work. This also gives us extra money to play with when the mortgage payments end.

Overpaying hits a number of goals for me though, not only the ownership, which is an emotional &gt; finance goal but it will help lower my LTV range (currently 85%) rather quickly thus helping me get competitive interest rates going forward. It will also get me a decent return from the interest i'm saving, I know 2.39 isn't a huge interest rate and there are current account that provide more, but as above, more of an emotional aspect than financial, unless this is really stupid. Finally if we come to sell, then we've more capital in the house to release. 

Investments
£300 pcm to go into a S&amp;S LISA starting in April.

This should get me about £900 per year from the GOV and will most likely be a large aspect of our pension pot, supplemented by mine and my wife's work pension. Mines not great, small company, my wife's is great, but she's only part time so not much money going in.

I was going to sit the LISA, I think, on Legal and Generals Global 100 Index fund for the foreseeable, that or a Vanguard Life Strategy and I just lower the equity value (risk/reward) overtime?

I've got £25 in a S&amp;S ISA for our daughter ( &amp; future kids) that is sitting on a Vanguard LS:80% . That's just for things like their first car + insurance or whatever when they're older and we'll be topping it up here and there.

Savings

£250 pcm savings - this is going to be used for house renovations and a family holiday throughout the year. This year target, the back garden. Excess will be used for other misc items or left in the savings and added to the Emergency Pot.

£60 Christmas Savings - ...

That leaves us something like £741.00 a month as just spending money.

Interested to see how other people would divide the pot as I'm always looking to learn more and ensure my wife and I have a good retirement + are able to support our kids when they're older.

I financed $22k at 3.9% for 36 months.  When I was talking to the finance manager, he said I had to keep the loan for 3-4 months but I can make a large payment for the first month (without paying off the loan).  However, he wasn't sure whether the loan would readjust monthly payments (currently $680) or decrease the term.

I'm planning on putting $20k down for the first month and letting the remaining $2k ride out regardless of whether monthly payments or term gets adjusted.

Is this a good idea and would this help my credit?"

I was already planning to study for the new PA role here in the U.K. but I've decided to humour the idea I could make it through medicine.

28,2017-01-01 21:00:01,About to be 1%er - questions/comments re: my investment + saving plan,"Hi everyone,

i'm 31 years old and just about to finish my medical residency. I've been reading non-stop about personal finance and investing in the last 2 years anticipating the huge jump with my earnings going from ~70K pre-tax as a lowly resident to a 1%er salary, which frankly makes me nervous and I don't want to mess this up like other docs. Here's the current situation:

Debt:

- Student LOC from bank: 180K at 2.7%

Salary starting July 2017:

- $270K take-home (EDIT: this is via salary not billings, so I will not be incorporating)

- This accounts for a 7.5% contribution matched by employer's 15% towards a pension (rural doc benefits!)

Contribution room:

- TFSA $93 K (including spouse's)

- RRSP: ~$50 K

My investment/debt repayment/savings plan for the first several years is as follows: 

- Live off at most 60-120K i.e. at my current lifestyle, meaning worst case scenario I will have $150K post-tax to invest/save

- Keep an asset allocation of 100% equities. I have read extensively into this and feel this is a manageable risk allocation for me, especially with the pension plan.

- Asset allocation: 38% US ETFs, 30% Canadian ETFs, 25% International ETFs, 7% emerging markets.

US ETFs: prioritize VTI in RRSPs, then bleed over to TFSA with VUN. I won't have much more RRSP room due to the pension, so this will eventually bleed into HXS in my taxable account.

Canadian: VCN in TFSAs, bleed into HXT in taxable.

International: VIU in TFSAs, then eventually take up 100% of the tax-sheltered room since there is no swap-based international ETFs. Continue to hold VIU as it bleeds into taxable.

Emerging markets: VEE in TFSA then taxable.

In the first 1-2 years I will prioritize maxing out my RRSP contributions, then paying off my LOC. This is definitely more psychological than economical but overall I can't wait to get this debt off my back. I'll then take the remainder and put it towards my TFSA. After the first 3+ years I imagine that all my registered accounts will be holding VIU and VEE. My taxable account will hold HXT, HXS, VIU, and VEE... unless they come out with an international swap ETF.

Questions:

1. Can you guys please comment on/critique my plan above?

2. With yearly investments of $150-210K+, would it be advantageous to find an advisor at some point, or should I continue to DIY, considering the possible returns on advisor accessible funds etc.?

Thanks in advance!

29,2017-01-01 10:34:53,Buy cheap or finance a mid ranged cost?,"Hello y'all, quick question here, as I'm unsure of what my best option is. 
I'll keep this short, but here's a quick backstory:
Started a pressure washing company (using a Honda CVR, ha), but now that I have business validation, I'm ready to commit to a work truck (will be driven quite often) so I can haul a trailer. I could also really use a quick injection of cash to get serious, spend about another grand and then my whole set up will be complete, making me more money quicker.

I can sell my Honda for around 10k, so my question is if down right buying a cheaper truck 5-8k (looking at older Tacomas most likely 150k miles+) is smarter than financing a newer Tacoma at a mid range of say, 15k (lower miles, obviously). 
If I did finance, from my crumby understanding of things, I would only have to put initial money down, get a monthly payment going, then I would still have much more investment money than if I chose to downright buy.

Am I understanding this properly? Not exactly sure what the smart thing to do is, since I've been told so many times buying down right is the best thing to do, but that leaves me with less investment money, and an older truck. Anyways, I hope I broke this down well. If y'all have any questions, please feel free to ask, as I'll be monitoring this thread actively for the next few hours.
Cheers everyone! Thanks in advance for any wisdom!"

31,2017-01-01 16:53:43,My (19F) grandmother (80F) is putting my grandfathers (80M) health at risk.,"So a bit of context to help you understand my situation. My mother (grandparents child) passed away from an aggressive and rare form of cancer when I was 13. Since then my family has been coping with the massive strain of losing the person who kept our family together. My mum was the person who could give you the power to solve your own issues. Whether that was health, finance, relationship issues, she was the one that you talked it through with. Without her myself, my husband (22M) and dad (54M) are doing all we can to make sure my grandparents are doing okay. My grandmother is a recovered alcoholic who had survived cancer herself, lost many children and lost her daughter before her own eyes at just 46. She craves control and always needs to know all the information about everyone's lives. I have had to work with mental health support providers and private therapists to discuss my relationship with my grandmother in more detail due to her narcissistic traits and the constant guilt trips. I could go into this a lot more but that is a post on its own. The most important part is that she is completely ignorant to risk or danger. She always puts things off and delays everything in her power. This is to their detriment and has caused a lot of rifts within the family. 
To be clear I love her and my grandfather enormously. They had a massive influence in my upbringing and the bond I have with them is so strong. 
Over the last few years my grandads independence has slowly decreased. He has stopped socialising as much, stopped playing golf, the company he worked for chose to close, many friends have passed away and his mental and physical health have declined. 
He is forgetful, and often can't remember significant information on that days plans or where we were supposed to be driving too. 
While he is mostly happy and comfortable he struggles with pain in his knees (leading to struggling with walking) and slight memory loss, which could be early signs of elderly memory and sensory disorders. He recently had some problems with his eyes and these are being treated and he is visiting the clinic regularly. 

My grandmother looks after his health and Drs appointments. However neither of them seem to really understand what is going on or what treatment he should receive. They can't seem to explain to us what the Drs have told them or what they will need to do next. 
He has been struggling with his mobility for about 3 years now. On the 2 occasions they have seen Drs that have talked with him about physiotherapy exercises (they didn't take this seriously) and he received 1 course of injections to help his joints. He has received no injections since the initial dose at the end of 2015. 
I feel like my grandmother is restricting his access to medical care by not wanting the bother of dealing with treatment for him. I feel like she does not take his (or her own) health seriously.  I see them about 2 times a week and speak to my grandmother every day and I suggest that every time that she gets him in to see a doctor to just check it over. Each time she says oh we will and brushes the matter off completely. 
My concern is that he is living in discomfort (he has expressed this to us numerous times) without understanding that medically people are there to help him. 

I am aware that there is no particular intervention we can take as he is almost completely independent and is living with his wife who is completely independent. I am just at a complete loss of what I can do to help and get them both the care they need. 
I have spent my entire life worrying about the health of my family and I am alone trying to support them. I'm at a loss of what to do next. 

I am scared that by them not taking issues seriously that the damage is going to be much more severe. 


We live in the U.K. with the NHS. 

Tl:dr Grandmother is not proactive in seeking medical help for my Grandad and I am worried about how this may affect him

I am pretty competent in the basics of daily finance. That is, I can make a decent budget to get by with money coming in from work and going out to expenses. But I have a boat load of debt (mostly student loans and medical debt) and really feel the need to sit down with someone more experienced than me and lay all my cards on the table and make a plan. I'd like to find someone who can look at my income, savings (ha!), debts, expenses - all the puzzle pieces - and help me make a plan for debt repayment, retirement, etc. Whenever I've looked into this on my own, I find people who are financial advisors for people who have a bunch of extra money and need advice about how to invest it. I'm not even at that point, but I'd like to be. Are there people who do this for a living? That is, help someone in my situation organize their finances well with the goal of getting out of debt and saving for retirement and reaching a few other goals? Thank you for any insight you have.

*On the Third day of January, 2028, being the Third Day of the First Month in the Buddhist Era 2571, the National Assembly and Privy Council, in Her Majesty's name, approved the following budget for the Tenasserim Federation.*

**2027**

* Population: 126,581,043 (0.2% growth rate)
* GDP: $901,351,538,494 (9.6% growth rate)
* GDP per Capita: $7,120

* GDP: $989,683,989,266 (9.8% growth rate)
* GDP per Capita: $7,803

**2028 Budget**

Total expenditures: $316,698,876,565 (32% of GDP)

Sector|Percentage|Amount
-|-|-
Ministry of War|12%|$38,003,865,188
Ministry of Education|15%|$47,504,831,485
Ministry of Health and Wellness|18%|$57,005,797,782
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure|15%|$47,504,831,485
Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment|7%|$22,168,921,360
Ministry of Labour and Employment|10%|$31,669,887,657
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources|10%|$31,669,887,657
Ministry of Finance|8%|$25,335,910,125
Ministry of Science|5%|$15,834,943,828

The continued expansion of the Tenasseri technology sector is seeing massive gains for the economy, as startups and established companies alike race to take advantage of the boom. A rise in spending has been balanced out by numerous investments in the Federation's future, and economic equity between the TSF's two halves is continuing to improve. Transfer payments and infrastructure projects will prove to be extremely effective in further growing the region's economy, while massive trade deals will show their worth over the next decade.

Trade with the TSF's neighbours has seen a boom the past few years, while numerous trade deals with major partners such as France and the Mediterranean Union will serve to spur massive growth over the next while. The Southeast Asian Union has expanded to include the TSF, Bangladesh, Laos, Kampuchea, and Sunda, making it one of the largest economic blocs in Southeast Asia. 

The conflict in Kashmir, while worrisome, has ended in more of a whimper than a bang for the time being, allaying fears of escalation. Intervention in East Africa has likewise seen successes, and the RTAF contingent in Tanzania looks to be acting as a mobile reserve to the coalition forces.

### [Republic of Laos, 2028](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Flag_of_Tay_Dam.png)

**2027**

* Population: 8,130,916 (1.1% growth rate)
* GDP: $60,425,335,516 (15% growth rate)
* GDP per Capita: $7,432

**2028 Projections**

* Population: 8,220,357 (1.1% growth rate)
* GDP: $69,005,733,160 (14.2% growth rate)
* GDP per Capita: $8,395

The continued efforts of the Southeast Asian Union to secure lucrative trade agreements has continued to fuel the so-called ""Laotian Economic Miracle"". Considerable investment in infrastructure projects will especially assist in Laos' continued development, along with a large influx of tourists. With millions of tourists visiting each year, combined with generous agricultural subsidies and investment in technology start-ups, Laos is proving to be a powerful economic player.

Growth has peaked last year at 15% with a massive influx of funding and investment returns, and is expected to gradually drop off to below 10% within a few years. Indeed, growth has reduced over the past three quarters, and will soon stabilise at more sustainable levels. The efforts of President Rasakham, however, have seen a sharp increase in the standard of living in Laos, and as such his government's popularity is at an all-time high.

**2027**

* Population: 18,448,163 (1.2% growth rate)

* GDP per Capita: $2,146

**2028 Projections**

* Population: 18,669,541 (1.2% growth rate)
* GDP: $45,129,082,802 (14% growth rate)
* GDP per Capita: $2,417

Kampuchea's reconstruction process is progressing at a breakneck pace, thanks in part to numerous investment and infrastructure packages through the SEAU. Demining has returned thousands of square kilometres of land to the Kampuchean people for use, and has contributed greatly to the recovery process. It will be a long road, but by the end of it all Kampuchea will once more stand tall and proud. 

Prime Minister Narong Phan's ability to secure economic aid and partnership is proving to be incredibly useful, and with the accession of Kampuchea to the Southeast Asian Union many expect to see tremendous leaps and bounds in re-development.

38,2017-01-01 04:27:51,My Weekly Shill: Banking and Wallbastions,"You can tweak existing mechanics all you want, but leaders need more tools to govern and protect their domestic sphere. This includes:

1a) Banking - Streamlined server-side system with in-game supplements to transfer/distribute/collect items. This could be ""Bank"" blocks (beacons that function as chests, as I will explain) that are connected to a group which any player can transfer items directly into the Bank. A couple safeguards: transfers must be made from within a certain distance of the Bank (perhaps 1000 blocks or less) as to prevent pro raiders from having instant remote dropchests. The beacon must be active (beam of light in the sky) for the Bank to work, preventing them from functioning as remote dropchests. A mod/admin/owner of the group must approve of any transaction from someone so that people can't just flood Banks with shit.

1b) I'm not a Finance major, so I'll leave the mechanics up to you for this. Group members should have the ability to open up personal accounts at the discretion of group mod/admin/owner. If everyone starts investing their wealth in it, then there needs to be a safeguard to prevent greedy group owners from breaking the block and stealing the sweet loot... perhaps a Bank block, once reinforced, is unable to be bypassed, and has 10 diamond reinforcements, each break spewing 10% of items or accounts from it. This would give people time to withdraw items from their account in the case of a greedy motherfucker(s) betraying.

2) Wallbastions - bastioned trenches are the only way to control traffic in and out of a city, which are rendered useless as soon as one or two bastions are broken. This is why they are not economically worth it, especially when you have only one type of bastion that has to be balanced to the expense of a vault). A special wallbastion (large radius, square, relatively weak, moderately inexpensive, permissions of owner/admin of group to blacklist individuals from wallbastions under the group) would provide effective safety and collective security for a majority of a city while being relatively ineffective for vaults or protection of serious wealth (because weakness to penetration). A safeguard to this should be that pearls cannot be stored in a chest within a wallbastion field and a wallbastion cannot be placed within 100 blocks of a vault bastion. You can read more about my thoughts on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/5j1bsh/entrypermissions_for_a_cityoriented_bastion/).

If we're to try to use Minecraft as a platform and draw from it's playerbase, we have to respect that there will always be a large range of skill in PvP. Those who comes to Civ servers to PvP expect to be able to attack and defend using mechanics they are familiar with, so we ought to respect that especially in an environment where the stakes are so high and people want to bring their previous skills/experience into the game seamlessly. However, the high stakes make it that much more important that there be other avenues for which people can leverage against or for others without or before resorting to 1v1-swords-swinging engagements to settle scores. If Civ servers keep living in their echo-chamber that the only viable way to engage in politics with other people who do not think like you is to be good at PvP, is this really a comprehensive political simulator?

If players/groups can create real, tangible control over their own territory and finances, then we may see more kinds of players willing to invest their time in this experiment."
39,2017-01-01 13:36:57,Lease Options,"I leased a car for a family member (they have horrible credit and co-signed. I agreed to make all of the payments for them) and they put way more miles on it than we were allowed. By the end of the lease i expect to have the miles almost exactly doubled.  
Car: Toyota Camry  
Bank: Southeast toyota finance  
Lease terms 3years/36k miles  
Payoff at end of lease: ~$18k

42,2017-01-01 18:35:58,2009 Honda Accord for 2015 Honda Civic?,"Hey all happy 2017!

I just paid off a 60-mo. Finance of a 2009 Honda Accord Ex with leather and a spoiler, remote start, with 92,000 miles. 

I believe I could get $6,000 for a trade-in perhaps and I've seen a few Honda Civics 2015 EX for 14,000. 

I could get a loan for 36 mos at 2.2% from my bank and would probably need 8,000 from them to purchase the car. 

Here's my questions/thoughts?

1.  My car is running fine and shows no signs of being a problem my only thought of trading in would be to get a newer car with under 30k miles on it now before the value of my car depreciates and the interest rate go up (assuming I drive the 2009 for another year or two)

A benefit of waiting is that I won't have car payments for a year or two and that could save me 2,000-4,000 just on not having payments over 1-2 years of driving the 2009. Then again I'd pay a higher rate for a loan then and the value of trade-in would go down with an older car and more miles (probably hit 105,000 in a year and 118,000 in two years). 

2. Based on these circumstances would you think it bad to trade-in now or would you wait a year or two then trade in regardless of interest rates for loans and car depreciation?"
43,2017-01-01 19:04:21,Buying a new construction in a gentrifying neighborhood?,"(TN)

Anyone familiar with the Nashville market knows that new construction is exploding in several neighborhoods. I've lived and rented in the area for 6 years now so have a pretty good overall lay of the land. My fiance and I have been priced out of the immediate urban core but are looking to stay as close as possible so he doesn't have a miserable commute in the mornings. We have 3 workplaces to consider, which led us to the neighborhood we're targeting now. 


We've toured a house that is perfect for us in almost every respect - square footage is spot on, price is spot on, has some really nice bonus features that we'd feel privileged to enjoy. The location would be perfect -- close to almost everywhere we frequent, lower crime than you might expect for an urban area -- if it weren't for the fact that we'd be the first ""tall and skinny"" on a block full of small, older, modest homes. Older Nashvillians have some strong opinions about the blight of these homes reaching into established neighborhoods and the guilt of being part of the problem is one of the only things holding us back from making an offer right now. 


The area does have a few break-ins now and then, this house would probably stick out like a sore thumb as a target. There are other new constructions (replacing older tear down homes) a few blocks over, and half a mile to the north they dominate the scene. Basically the only reason we can afford this house is because its the first of its kind on the street in question. Based on comps a few streets over it seems to be a fair price, possibly even a great deal. 


Are there any other factors we should consider when considering a house like this? For anyone specifically familiar with Nashville, we're looking in Radnor, just southwest of Woodbine. 

Edit: Including some personal finance details in case it impacts any advice. House is listed at $350,000. We'd put 20% down and will have ~$50k left over (not including retirement accounts) for any closing costs/moving costs, and emergency fund. I make $100k/year, fiance makes 35k/year. My job is pretty secure and we're confident I could find another one quickly if I needed to. "

So do I just call my dealership up and send the check to them? Is that all I have to do to refinance? Do I just get approved through my credit union and have no other paperwork with the dealer? 

Thank you.

Also, how do I know if there is a pre-payment penalty? I asked around before and people have said it is rare to have pre-payment penalty through Honda dealers. The finance forms I signed said: ""You may be subject to a charge if you decide to pay off your loan early."" I asked the finance manager that worked with me and he said I ""could prepay."""
46,2017-01-01 22:04:43,Q4BP: Does the Bachelorette show confirm men don't like women with high N counts?,"https://www.bustle.com/articles/160990-why-nick-vialls-sex-talk-with-andi-dorfman-on-the-bachelorette-was-such-a-big-deal

Considering the Bachelorette show is very popular among women these days and the guys on the show are ""Chad"" type dudes who are very socially ""dominant"", this is another example of the fact that men DONT LIKE WOMEN with high N counts.

Josh is a semi pro baseball player that literally WON the show and was a ""catch"" but ultimately dumped his finance Andy Dorfman for banging some other dude on the show.

Josh was very upset that she was sleeping around and gave her the boot.

Josh doesn't strike me an ""insecure"" low SMV type dude yet here he is giving Andy the boot for sleeping around.

Thoughts?

Here is another example of a ""Kaitlin"" who also slept with Nick and is being hardcore disliked for getting banged out by the other men AND RANDOM MEN through twitter messages

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8bwye0jupo

Don't these guys who are considered ""alpha"" realize high N counts don't mean much for women?   Are these guys ""insecure""?

Seems like high N count women aren't liked by most men

48,2017-01-01 02:40:47,"[Credit]How many years before I can get an AMEX blue cash Pcard? 20 y/o, college, no car/job","Hi, Personal Finance. I'm a 20 year old college student in Florida: no job, no car, 11k in loans, no past credit cards. I stupidly applied to AMEX after reading about credit cards for about a day, denied instantly of course. Like most, I was attracted to how much money I would save on groceries.

My credit score is 632.

I turn 21 in the summer.
I can almost certainly get a pseudo-internship (work experience in a defense contractor) in the summer and plan on pushing until I do so. I will probably also have a car at that point. I plan on paying off all my loans the first year out of college if I land an engineering job (2 years +/- .5).

What should I do to expedite?

Could I still apply while paying off my loans after getting a stable job and car?

What are necessary ""stepping stones"" to getting accepted to AMEX?

Recommendations for improving credit score?



Thank you oh so very much for whatever advice you can give to a noob during your work breaks browsing Reddit, PF!

Dear Yadnarav,
I am a freelance journalist and M.A student at the Columbia University Journalism School in New York City, with a business concentration. Having a supervisor editor-in-chef Andy Serwer at Yahoo Finance, I am writing an in-depth feature story, my master thesis project, about anonymous messaging and the social media app Yik Yak.
I approach you with a question whether you could help me out in my research. I’m looking for users of the app to talk about their experiences. I believe that users are the best sources to tell me why the app become so popular among students and why did it lost its popularity over the last year.
I see that you have discussed about Yik Yak on Reddit, and it seems to me that you could be a good source to be interviewed for my project. Would it be possible for you to answer a couple of questions below?
You can do by email or by phone. If you prefer that I call to you, please let me know your number and when would be best time to call. My questions are:
For what kind of messaging did you use Yik Yak? How often? What is/was the best part of it? The most annoying part? Did you find it useful? Are you still using it? Why?
Why the app lost its popularity in your view? Do you know people still using it?
The Master Thesis is a journalistic piece which aims to be published. In the story, I can’t use anonymous sources unfortunately. Please let me know also your your name and the school where you have used the app.
In advance, thank you. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions. I appreciate your help.

51,2017-01-01 12:49:25,"Bought new phone from 3rd party Verizon dealer, they completely lied to me and I'm not sure what to do","Hi Guys. My wife and I are on the same plan. I bought a new phone about 3 to 4 months ago from a 3rd party dealer. Our contract was up from when we signed up at Costco 2 years prior. My wife had bought a phone at full price 8 months before and didn't need an upgrade on her phone. I needed a new phone.

The guy at the store told me they weren't doing contracts anymore. He said he could finance a phone for me and be a little less on our monthly bill than we currently were. He said this was basically because my wife wasn't upgrading her phone. We were paying $125 per month for 2 lines, 2gb data + 2gb bonus (4gb total shared). He also told me that I could trade in my current phone for $200. After 2 days I came back in and took him up on the offer and got the S7 Edge phone. He told me it might take a month or two for the pricing to sort itself out on our bill and then it would be around $120 per month total, my phone payment included. And Verizon would mail me a kit to mail my old phone in to get the $200.

He was right, the first bill was funky and high. The next bill and the next was $150 and $155, and we no longer had our bonus 2 gb data (we went over our data the 2nd month, not the first). And no kit from Verizon to turn in my old phone.

I have kind of screwed up as it has almost been 4 months and I haven't reached out to the dealer. I had to have surgery, and had a lot going on. Now I have time and want to figure this out. Any tips?

I'm quite upset by this and since I am not in contract I have no issue leaving Verizon. I am fine paying off the phone, I didn't need to finance it in the first place but being a business owner I'm always thinking cash flow. I'd prefer not to go to T-mobile as they screwed me over in the past. My wife and I don't need a ton of data but we like to have nice smart Android smart phones.

Any advice would be great, thank you."

OK here is my situation. The wife and I handed been working with this clinic for fertility related treatment. The insurance has covered a sizable portion of our bill. Unfortunately, our insurance has a lifetime maximum benefit of 15k for fertility treatment and we hit the limit a few months back. Ever since that, it seems our bills no longer shows any in-network rate. For instance, we had a bill in the middle of the year with an amount of 550. The amount paid by the insurance company together from ourselves is around 450. We received the exact same treatment later this year after we hit the maximum and the new bill shows that we are responsible for the whole 550.

We called the insurance company and they confirmed that it is expected and after we hurt the maximum it Will be like we have no insurance at all. We then called the clinic and asked if they offer any no insurance rate and they said no.

I guess my question really is, is it right for the insurance company to remove the in-network rate after we hit the maximum? I mean I understand that the insurance would not pay a dime after that but it's it right legally or not to not apply in-network rate? I'm looking art a substantial difference here.

I'm 25, about to finish my PhD in Chemistry in March at a top UK University. I do synthetic inorganic chemistry. I have received a fellowship for April 2017-2018 to continue my own research independently at this institution, it's quite a prestigious fellowship.

I graduated with a Chemistry MChem (1st class) from the same university, but I have done a few months work in the US so I've shown some ability to travel for work already. Additionally I have a verbal offer to do post-Doctoral work in the US and have connections to work at places like MIT, Harvard or CalTech if they are a good fit for me. 

Currently I like academia, I can see myself enjoying the career, but my understanding of the salary and pay scales is that it's not really equal to the hours put in, for the professional qualifications you need to have...

Long term I'd like to be earning towards the £100k mark by 35-40 to support my partner and myself wherever we want to live, obviously the younger I can achieve this the better. I'm struggling to think of career sectors where this is possible with my PhD, except maybe finance which has never really drawn me.

I've found [this](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions), from the IRS, and [this](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=31), from a charity rating site.

So, if I've got everything correct, I would make donations throughout the year, gathering proper documentation, and then when the time comes to settle I'd fill out the appropriate forms when I file my taxes?

More confusing to me is the way that the tax deduction is handled. There's the part about tax brackets, and actual costs, etc. So, if I donate $80, and my tax bracket is 20%, then I would be able to deduct $100 from my taxes?

When the time comes, would Finance be able to handle all this stuff for me? I heard they file taxes for soldiers?

*****
&gt; The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries - it&amp;#039;s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.

&gt; Levin defines intervention as &amp;quot;a costly act which is designed to determine the election results one of the two sides.&amp;quot; These acts, carried out in secret two-thirds of the time, include funding the election campaigns of specific parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda, training locals of only one side in various campaigning or get-out-the-vote techniques, helping one side design their campaign materials, making public pronouncements or threats in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or withdrawing foreign aid.

&gt; Russia attempted to sway 36 foreign elections from the end of World War II to the turn of the century - meaning that, in total, at least one of the two great powers of the 20th century intervened in about 1 of every 9 competitive, national-level executive elections in that time period.

&gt; Throughout the Cold War, U.S. involvement in foreign elections was mainly motivated by the goal of containing communism, said Thomas Carothers, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

&gt; In the 1990 Nicaragua elections, the CIA leaked damaging information on alleged corruption by the Marxist Sandinistas to German newspapers, according to Levin.

&gt; The New York Times reported in the 1990s that the CIA had on its payroll members of the military junta that would ultimately unseat Aristide after he was democratically elected in a landslide over Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official and finance minister favored by the U.S. The U.S. also attempted to sway Russian elections.

Foxconn’s clout as Apple’s manufacturing partner nets billions in incentives,"This is an automatic summary, [original](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/12/web-of-tax-breaks-and-subsidies-keeps-iphone-production-in-china/) reduced by 32%.
*****
&gt; Apple sells iPhones all over the world, but it builds them in China with the help of manufacturing companies like Foxconn and Pegatron.

&gt; A particular Foxconn facility in the city of Zhengzhou, China, is the subject of a lengthy report in The New York Times today.

&gt; The report details the complex series of tax breaks, subsidies, and other incentives that makes the Zhengzhou facility so uniquely suited to Foxconn&amp;#039;s and Apple&amp;#039;s needs.

&gt; Confidential government records obtained by the Times reveal, among other things, that the city of Zhengzhou helped finance the construction of Foxconn&amp;#039;s factory and housing for its workers; that it provides discounted energy and constructed power generators and other infrastructure to support the facility; that it has waived and deeply cut corporate and value-added taxes; that it helps Foxconn hire and train workers; that it put its factory inside a &amp;quot;Bonded zone&amp;quot; that made selling devices within China easier; and that it spent a total of $10 billion to upgrade an airport to make exporting products from China quicker and easier for Apple and other companies.

&gt; Apple relies on Foxconn to keep its costs down and profit margins up, and Foxconn relies on orders from Apple to maintain the size and clout that makes it possible for Foxconn to cut such favorable deals in the first place.

&gt; Trump asserted on the campaign trail that he would &amp;quot;Get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.&amp;quot; Since the election he has spoken with Apple CEO Tim Cook about building &amp;quot;a big plant&amp;quot; in the US. The Times report highlights just how difficult it would be to recreate those incentives and move those manufacturing jobs to the United States or anywhere else.

""I don't need a secretary."" I said again, rubbing the bridge of my nose. ""Besides, what will everyone think if I have a young college girl hanging around my office all the time.""

""She's a good respectful girl. She always acts mature, she could easily pass for older, and who knows she might attract more business!"" He argued. ""Listen, she's a thousand miles from home, going to school and hating her dorm roommate. I told her she can't get an apartment unless she has a job, but she can't find anyone hiring that isn't just fast food.""

I hung up the phone and stared at my computer screen again.

It even had a picture of a pretty young woman, taken at some summer program with a thin white tee and some shorts. She might not scare off my male customers, but I could see a few female ones getting suspicious or jealous of their husband's staring. 

But no turning back now. She'll be here first thing tomorrow, and I better find something for her to do.

____________________________________________________

Hi DPP. I've had this idea in my head for a few days and finally decided to hash it out. 

The idea is that I'm your dad's old friend, how or why doesn't matter, but now you're attending a college that's in the city I'm in, but your parents are far away. Naturally you hate living with some stranger and really want an apartment your dad doesn't want to pay for. 

His solution is to get you a job as a little personal assistant to his old friend, then you can earn some money, he'll help pay rent and you can continue studying and having a fun college experience. 

So we'll start off there. You'll be coming to my office, dressed as nice as a broke college girl can, and eventually it'll lead to more sexy areas as the story goes on, you can be the sweet innocent girl your dad thinks you are, or you can be a horny college girl wanting to experience more than lectures as you go to class. The only thing I'm not looking for, is some super slut that'll immediately go to sucking my dick to get out of work. I'd rather build to the sex rather than trade favors. 

All that said, I also left the actual job vague and open. You can pick what you want to be doing in the RP, and I'll go with it. Maybe you majored in Art and I can be a Gallery Manager, or maybe you're in finance and I'm an accountant. Whatever it is, just include it in your reply and I'll do the best I can."

67,2017-01-01 19:00:14,How does the number of inquiries affect your credit score?,"Long story short, I wanted a vehicle that was on the lot of a ""We finance anyone"" car lot. Although I planned to finance through my bank, I allowed them to run my credit through their lenders to see if they could get me a better rate. This resulted in 7 separate HARD credit inquiries showing up on my credit report, just for that!

According to Capital One's Creditwise web site the number of inquiries I have is below average. However their estimator doesn't allow me to see how it would affect my score if they were not there (5 inquiries in the last 2 years as opposed to 12 currently).

I am looking at getting re-finance on my house this year and do not want to wait the 24 months for these to fall off. (They are from last June).

I don't want it affecting my rate, or ability to secure a loan.

Is there a way to have those inquiries removed to increase my credit score? Or am I worried for nothing and they have little bearing on my credit score?"
68,2017-01-01 19:15:24,Young male looking to divest from Acorns,"Hey there everyone,
I am a 23 year old male in California. Currently make a $40k salary annually. With new years resolutions being in the air I managed to complete my 2016 resolution in March: Become employed in my career full time. This has given me a ton of opportunities financially and I've been following personal finance most of the way.
That being said I've created my emergency fund and crushed my debt (only $1800) remaining on my car left. 

However I am in a unique position. I live with my parents still, I can afford to move but not without roomates (poor student friends cant afford to join me). I also have not been employed long enough to qualify for the 401k till about April. So i've been investing some spare cash into Acorns investment (under 24 y/o so no fees). 

I understand the r/personalfinance community isn't particularly enthused by Acorns due to their fee structure. However I enjoy the roundup capability as it saves up even more money than I psycologically feel safe doing without impacting my spending enough for me to notice. At the moment my CU doesnt have this kind of ""round-up"" product. I am wondering if there is better way for me to divest into a round-up savings account followed by a small investment platform like robinhood? Or should I hang out another year and divest once I am coming up on the area where fees are being charged? "

70,2017-01-01 22:22:25,College student looking for a serious career advice,"Just turned 24, took 2.5 year break from college(on and off), and  just need 2 semesters to graduate at a top 10 business undergrad.

I went through an existential crisis which led me to be suicidal and emotionally/mentally unstable, but have now recovered and am eager/determined to study and work hard. My GPA dropped from 3.9 to 2.2 after 3 semesters since I just skipped the quiz/hw/exams/classes etc. 

Currently my major in business is MIS, but I am debating on switching over to Finance. I already feel so behind seeing my friends work at corporate jobs and I feel so old already. I am not too concerned about my GPA since I can raise it up, but I just want to secure a professional career and get things rolling.

What can I do to mitigate the damage I caused from my hiatus/emotional breakdown and is it worth for me to even finish a degree in business? I am debating on changing my studies to computer science/chemistry and perhaps just pursue a PhD in that area...

My main motivation in life is to earn a lot of money. I would just like an outside opinion/advice, thanks."
71,2017-01-01 23:45:42,How much should I spend on a house?,"I'm 32 and single, looking to really buy my first house. I did own a house about 5 years ago in a cheap neighborhood, foreclosure, fixed it up and it got robbed. Sold it immediately after that, then bought a short sale and got such a good deal I flipped it while renting and made some money so I did it again. So I do have some housing experience and know how and understand the real costs of home ownership. I am looking for some advice on what to spend now as I am looking to lay some roots.  Perhaps as much of a real estate question as a personal finance, but I would like to get a financial perspective as well. I live in a top 50 US metropolitan area. Median home price is about 350k. It has desirable waterfront areas that are scarce in the area, but thats where all the business owners, execs, etc live. I see it as recession proof, blue chip investment. However those are expensive. So do I buy a cheap house and try to invest elsewhere or do I go for a good property in a good neighborhood. My hesitancy with anything cheap is I wont love the house itself and run the risk of bad part of town and worrying about getting burglarized. That and your neighbors generally aren't the type of people that would help advance my career/business.  My clients are medium to large business owners. My hesitancy with the nicer neighborhood is that I will be stretching myself too thin and or settle for whatever I can afford and possibly not love the house. So how much should I spend and whats the better investment?  My stats, 130k cash in bank, 110k salary with variable annual bonus of 20-30k, stable company, stable job, exec level at small business so networking is key, 100k in 401k (I put 10% in currently), $0 debt, own a truck outright, lease a luxury car for $400/mo, I don't really spend a ton of money, my biggest flaw is eating out all the time, but i do that because i don't even have to think about money (my current rent is $400). So, I could tone that down. Any help, advice?"
72,2017-01-01 03:29:17,01-01 08:29 - 'Why a EU Free Trade deal is no where close to being in the single market' (self.unitedkingdom) by /u/KL_boy removed from /r/unitedkingdom within 2494-2499min,"'''

I keep seeing people / politicians /Brexiters suggest that once we get a EU free trade deal, we will be fine. Just to be clear, a EU free trade deal is not even close to what we have by being in the single market. Average tariff are about 5 - 7% of goods, but in return, we will have to manage

*Longer and more expensive import / export. The extra paperwork, red tape, duties, storage, etc will create a drag on movements. Just to put it in perspective, it cost about 50 - 100euros extra to ship to Norway due to ""custom clearance"" and paperwork, and they are just in the EEA. 

*Our manufacturing supply chain will be more expensive, as we import a lot of semi finish and raw materials from the EU. A lot of companies also have complex supply chain which include the UK, which are now in jeopardy.  

*We will have to comply with individual EU countries import requirements rather than just complying to UK regulation that we have now.   

*The UK will not be able to sell services to the EU, something which is a very big chunk of  our economy. This will include activities like finance, software, accounting, consulting, law, etc

*EU HQ activities will have to be moved to another countries, such as European sales, central reporting, etc, materials ownership and VAT registration abroad.  

*UK products will now face certificate of origin issues, making our products less attractive to purchase for the EU.    

And all people are concerned about is that 5 -7% import tariff?

75,2017-01-01 09:09:48,looking for a room/roommates to apartment hunt,"Hello everyone, I'm posting this hoping that there would be some people looking for apartments or roommates for 2/1/2017.

To begin, my budget is around $850~$1000, and I'm looking mostly in Bushwick, South Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Astoria, Bed Stuy, Prospect Heights, Sunset Park, Crown Heights, Ridgewood, Astoria, Park Slope and open to other neighborhoods.

About me, I'm a male student who is an upper freshman at a college located in mid-town Manhattan and I will probably at school every weekday and when I'm home, I would be home struggling to finish my assignments. This doesn't mean I'm not a fun person but love hanging out with people and meeting new people. I also love to eat out with my roommates time to time if that is what you would be interested in. I like to watch Netflix/HBO and try to stay tuned in with latest fashion trends. additionally, I'm clean and believe in clean common areas. I love dogs and cats and most of animals so do not hesitate! I'll also be staying in the city for years and am willing to sign up a year lease. 

About my situation, I'm a student from overseas so therefore I have a guarantor overseas who can sign my documents. I'm also flexible to pay First/Last/Security deposit and another month if necessary. I have never had an issue with my landlords/managements for not being able to pay rents. I'm young but I handle my finance extremely well and i can assure you that I can pay rents on time.
Thank you for reading and please message me if you are interested in order for us work things out.

Daniel :)"

This is an extended summary, original article can be found [here](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Were-Jaitley-CEA-consulted-on-demonetisation-RBI-refuses-to-answer-RTI-query/article16973579.ece)

# Extended Summary:

**Were Jaitley, CEA consulted on demonetisation? RBI refuses to answer RTI query**.

Whether views of the Chief Economic Advisor and the Finance Minister were taken before the sudden announcement of demonetisation of high-value currency notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8? The Reserve Bank of India feels this query cannot be answered under the Right to Information Act as it does not comes under the definition of information under the transparency law.

Query is in the nature of seeking opinion from CPIO which is not defined as information as per Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, the RBI said in response to an RTI query.

It is a fact sought by an RTI applicant.

Whether someone was consulted or not is a matter of record.

The query was also sent to the Prime Ministers Office and the Finance Ministry but it remained unanswered even after 30 days of filing of the RTI application.

1000 currency notes.

The monetary policy regulator also did not disclose if the decision to demonetise currency notes worth Rs 20 lakh crore was opposed by any official or minister, saying the information sought is hypothetical in nature.

Information sought under Section 8(1)(g) would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes.

Earlier, it had denied to Mumbai-based RTI Activist Anil Galgali information about distribution of currency to banks between November 9, 2016 and November 19, 2016 citing Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act.

78,2017-01-01 09:57:07,Buy a cheap truck or lease a mid-ranged one?,"Hello personal finance, quick question here, as I'm unsure of what my best option is. 
I'll keep this short, but here's a quick backstory:
Started a pressure washing company (using a Honda CVR, ha), but now that I have business validation, I'm ready to commit to a work truck (will be driven quite often) so I can haul a trailer. I could also really use a quick injection of cash to get serious, spend about another grand and then my whole set up will be complete, making me more money quicker.

I can sell my Honda for around 10k, so my question is if down right buying a cheaper truck 5-8k (looking at older Tacomas most likely 150k miles+) is smarter than financing a newer Tacoma at a mid range of say, 15k (lower miles, obviously). 
If I did finance, from my crumby understanding of things, I would only have to put initial money down, get a monthly payment going, then I would still have much more investment money than if I chose to downright buy.

Am I understanding this properly? Not exactly sure what the smart thing to do is, since I've been told so many times buying down right is the best thing to do, but that leaves me with less investment money, and an older truck. Anyways, I hope I broke this down well. If y'all have any questions, please feel free to ask, as I'll be monitoring this thread actively for the next few hours.
Cheers everyone! Thanks in advance for any wisdom!"

# Extended Summary:

**Govt mulls 10 paise cess to provide social safety to Railways coolies**.

NEW DELHI: Railway coolies roughly 20,000  may soon be part of the social safety net as the government is weighing a cess of 10 paise on every rail ticket to bring them under the ambit of schemes run by retirement fund body EPFO.

38 crore every year, which will be enough to provide basic minimum facilities like PF, pension and group insurance to coolies.

2 lakh every day for the purpose.

A senior ministry official said, The labour ministry will soon take up the proposal with Indian Railways and the finance ministry for levying the cess, which will be a negligible amount for passengers, but would help bring these 20,000 workers under the social security net of EPFO.

It will not be levied per passenger.

83,2017-01-01 16:06:51,Am I making a good choice? [University Student],"I graduated high school this year and honestly I don't know what I want to do. I decided to go to university and take a commerce degree. In my opinion, what I will learn from a business degree will help me regardless what career path I choose. I'm interested in finance, so over the next summer I plan on applying at banks branches all over. Hopefully I will get some roots set in banks or business' in my area. I'll make sure they know I'm a uni student who's interested in that field of work. I am doing this also so I can learn about the field of work too (I'm very ready to learn). I'm aware I'm taking a risk, but I'm working as hard as possible for this. Am I crazy for doing this? Or am I just setting myself up for failure? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Side Note: I had a recent encounter with a bank branch owner who's successful and owns his own branch. He told me that my business degree is useless and I shouldn't try. He said that they only care about business students from popular universities like Harvard or McGail. I politely thanked him for his information but disagreed with him in every way. It made me just want to try harder and work harder to prove him wrong. 

I can't help but have self doubts. Maybe I'm just some ignorant student who doesn't see that it won't work out for me. On the other hand, my lack of confidence could be clouding my judgment to see the path to succeed. Any advice would be great. Thank you.

84,2017-01-01 02:24:40,01-01 07:24 - 'UK Customs Systems and Brexit' (self.unitedkingdom) by /u/tweeglitch removed from /r/unitedkingdom within 410-415min,"'''

Firstly I’m no expert. Most of what I know about this issue is contained within the text below in which there will be mistakes. I may get in a muddle here and there on certain details but I think the broad thrust will be correct. It’s an issue I’ve been mulling over the past six months since I heard how quickly and completely the UK may end up exiting the EU. My immediate thought back then was: hang on what about all the IT systems, the EU wide systems the UK uses and so will have to implement its own, and UK systems’ integration with EU systems and the implementation of EU rules in UK IT systems which will no longer apply post exit. And then my next thoughts were: is there enough time for this work? and if failure results in a breakdown of these systems what are the consequences? And then I wandered what these systems might be? The most obviously impacted one I thought must be government customs, surely this isn’t paper based any more. And so the ‘mulling’ began and I’ve been mulling since so this is likely to be long, apologies in advance. But like i say I ain’t no expert so if you are or at least can counter any of the below then well generally as with most people I prefer to be right but in this case PLEASE DO!  

We'll take it as read the UK will leave the customs union and single market two years post article 50 notification. And there’ll be no transitional period during which systems can be adapted to the new rules of trade between the UK and most of the rest of the world. The falling off a 'cliff edge' Brexit. Maybe that won’t be the case but it’s looking increasingly likely. If that were to happen then the biggest problem will not be the new more cumbersome slower expensive etc routes to trade as a result of implementing whatever new rules there may be in terms of tariffs, quotas, customs checks. There is a much greater upheaval from the disruption caused in attempting to transition to that new and shittier state, in attempting to adapt customs systems and processes and facilities to the new rules in the extremely limited time there'll be available. Because there won’t be enough time. 

I keep reading articles about ‘cliff edge’ brexit scenarios where the UK falls on to WTO rules (although many of those rules will be undecided e.g. quotas) how there’ll be extra red tape and how much more expensive imports will be and the added uncompetitiveness of UK exports due to tariffs and the disruption to supply chains due to the extra customs checks causing some manufacturers to move their production out of the UK and so on and so on. 

Articles like this by Nick Clegg [link]^^1  

or this one from Richard North about the dangers of the ‘WTO Option’ [link]^^2  
Richard North is a leave supporter who has always argued for a gradual exit by first re-joining EFTA through the UK’s existing EEA membership. 

And here’s a typical one (an extract from a forthcoming book) [link]^^3  

What none of them take in to account. What no one as far as I can see is taking in to account! Is that in order to get to this new state work needs to be done. There is not enough time to do this work. So as bad as those ‘worst case’ scenarios look what will make them even worse will be a situation in which the UK government’s customs systems simply do not work as a result of failing to implement in time the changes needed for the UK’s new trading environment. No one is asking what the systems implications, dependencies, costs and timescales of re-introducing hard customs borders with the EU are and whether it is even possible to do this in the time available and what the consequences of failure will be. Google it. Seek and you will not find. In a sense the arguments made in those articles by Clegg and Richard North and so on and generally arguments for or against whatever trading arrangements there may be post hard brexit are all moot. It’s a bit like arguing the pros and cons of life on Mars when the only means of getting there is to stuff yourselves in to a giant cannon roughly aimed at that red planet. There is no time to implement those new trading arrangements. You ain't gonna get anywhere near Mars however nice or not it might be to live there.

We are talking here principally about IT systems and the failure of a number of systems of vital infrastructural importance to the UK economy. Systems in the finance sector, supply chain systems, but particularly government customs systems. So before we begin I’ll just get one potential counter argument out of the way. This is not another Y2K scare story. Firstly Y2K was not just a scare story. It would have been a problem if the work hadn't been done. The work got done. It was a very widespread issue but you could have trained monkeys to make most of those code changes. It was basically the same simple fixes made over and over in loads of different places, ok sometimes finding the problems e.g. embedded systems was hard but there were no changes to business rules just fixes to code. A programmer or analyst would not have needed to ask a domain expert (accountant banker tax consultant or whoever the system is for) if some date in a calculation is supposed to wrap round to 1900. It was mostly all at the code level and similarly though to a lesser extent so was the euro introduction. With Brexit though the rules are changing and no one yet knows to what, all we know so far is that Brexit means Brexit. This problem is fundamentally different to Y2K.

So to customs systems. What do they do? Customs processing in the UK is presently handled by a system called Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (CHIEF). HMRC’s CHIEF system manages the declaration and movement of goods into and out of the UK calculating and collecting revenue thereon. It is also (for the time being at least) a means by which UK traders communicate with counterpart customs systems in other EU states. It also (again for the time being at least) connects with the EU’s Import Control System (ICS) which allows the sharing of security and safety data regarding the movement of goods among member states. Further it is integrated with the goods scheduling systems at UK ports and airports (pause and ponder for a moment here… integrated with goods scheduling systems in every UK port). I’m told Dover has an average goods in waiting time of 40 minutes… well for the time being at least.

What is the current state of these systems? CHIEF was not written yesterday by teenagers in javascript using node js. You can’t download the source from Github. You can't run it on your phone. You look at it via special green screen terminals. It’s written in dun-dun duuuun… COBOL! It’s communication protocol is EDIFACT. It’s DBMS is IDMS(X) and OS is VME both from ICL. ICL went out of business 15 years ago! This is 80s technology! It’s a completely different world to the one most developers nowadays are accustomed to. For several years HMRC had been throwing cash (around a billion maybe) at CapGemini and Accenture for a ground up re-write (anyone who knows anything about large legacy IT systems should shudder at the phrase). It came to nothing. They are presently part way through another re-write attempt this time with IBM. This new system is called the Customs Declaration Service (CDS) and was made necessary due to CHIEF becoming unmodifiable and the wide ranging changes needed to implement the EU's new Union Customs Code (UCC). UCC is a common set of customs processes to be adopted by all EU members. 
[link]^^4  

CDS is due to come on line early 2019, a few months before the UK's currently projected EU exit date. This is already an at-risk project. The risks of a ground up re-write are enormous; an existing system will have had years of real life testing by users. Systems become increasingly difficult to change mostly due to the complexity arising from an accretion of fixes and enhancements so developers start crying for a re-write as most want to write new stuff not fix some other chump’s work. The existing system would need to have been fully documented and that documentation painstakingly kept up to date for all the years worth of subsequent modifications because that documentation is the source of truth for what the current system does and so what the new ground up rewrite may need to do. Even without brexit we’re looking at a car crash here.

So what work would need to be done should the UK leave the customs union and single market after the two year article 50 period? With no replacement EU-UK trade agreement tariffs will be applied by the UK on EU goods entering the UK. This it will have to do under the WTO's most favoured trading nation rules (MFN) unless the UK unilaterally drops all tariffs. Competition from third world countries would gut UK industry and agriculture so setting all tariffs to zero is unlikely. It also leaves the UK nothing to bargain with in order to reduced the tariffs on its exports so again unlikely. And likewise by the same MFN rules the EU will be obliged to charge tariffs on UK goods being sold in the EU. This introduces a change in how the UK conducts over 40% of its international business. However it will result in a greater than 40% increase in the number of declarations being fed through whatever customs system the UK may have (CHIEF or CDS) once exit finally happens because many small businesses will have taken advantage of the ease and simplicity of trading within the EU as opposed exporting out of it (see also for example how VAT works for inter-EU trade as opposed importing in to the EU from out). However as well as the change in rules for UK/EU trade and the necessary scaling of the system to meet the increase in data throughput there are also changes needed for trade between the UK and other trading blocs and non-EU countries. This is because the EU over the decades has negotiated on behalf of its members 40 or so trade agreements which on exit the UK will no longer be a party to (it will have no trade agreements). So basically the rules which govern how the UK trades with the entire world will change. That’s quite a wide ranging set of changes, it kinda looks like everything this system does will need some sort of amendment.

So a lot of work to do but what track record does the UK government have for delivering large IT projects in time and within budget? As per IT projects for most governments and large companies, pretty appalling! We’re talking years of overrun and manned mission to Mars scales of money wasted. UK government IT project fails: E-Borders, half a billion spent over several years before abandonment. The BBC’s digital media system a billion spent over several years before that too was abandoned due to becoming obsolete while still being developed! NHS Connecting for Health mostly abandoned but some parts continued, ten years, 12 billion spent 10 billion over budget. And then the Universal Credit System (Brexiteer extraordinaire Idiot Dumb Dumb Smith's baby) a whopping 12.8 billion since 2013 with 2.2 originally planned.

So a lot of work to do and not a great track record when it comes to delivery on time and within budget. So what time might be available to complete this work? On the issue of scaling for the increase in declarations HMRC have said they are already doing this. It is after all something they can do now and adapting a modern system (the CDS system currently under development) for a greater load is not so much of a problem, servers can be added to meet the demand as and when. Scaling the existing CHIEF system would probably be a non-starter. However it’s likely that CDS will overrun and not be ready in time for brexit in which case HMRC may have to start looking at updating CHIEF. Oh boy. The single article I’ve seen on this topic area (and I check everyday) in the main stream media was in the FT and the problem was couched solely in terms of this, i.e. the need to scale the system for the increased load. The reason being is that HMRC have announced that this is work they are doing and so the FT dutifully reported it. What HMRC haven’t said is what work they are not doing. The work they are not doing is modifying systems for the changes that will come in terms of tariffs, quotas, customs checks for valuation, rules of origin and security particularly if the UK is no longer a participant of the EU’s ICS. And of course being journalists it hasn’t entered their pretty little humanities degree heads that this is work that will need to be done. Or perhaps they imagine the magic code fairy will descend from the heavens on exit day’s eve and with a wave of the wand all this work will be finished in an instant. 

Work relating to the new rules of trade can only start once negotiations are complete. It isn’t until the negotiations are done and any agreements signed that there can be any surety and clarity on what those new rules are then from those rules technical specifications can be drawn up i.e. scribble something on the back of a fag packet to hand to the programmers. So if those negotiations take no time at all then the developers would have the whole two years allowed by the article 50 process (which would still be suicidally tight). If on the other hand negotiations use up the entire two year period then they have a remaining zero seconds to complete the work. I would tend toward the latter. Quite a challenging deadline then and particularly so for a government IT project.

What is the likelihood of failure? Doh! The situation is analogous to an army on the move i.e. customs systems are being moved from the old CHEIF system to the re-write that is CDS. This army on the move is about to be ambushed (because there is no time to prepare) by an overwhelming force because there doesn’t appear to be much that this system does which won’t in some way need changing i.e. every function point will be under attack from a hail of change requests. There is no fallback system in the case of failure. In those other examples of failed government IT projects the existing system could continue to be used but in this case not so unless perhaps the UK accepts Schengen, the euro currency and pays the full EU dues. Also in those other IT failure cases if the project overran then they have the option to continue plugging away until the money runs out. Hard Brexit on the other hand delivers a hard deadline. Once you are out you are out, pencils down, times up, whether you’re finished or not. Which all makes failure more assured. 

There are further exacerbating factors which make failure all the more likely. The time constraint imposed by not being able to start work on the changes until the changes that need making are known, and the changes which need making won’t be known until negotiations are complete, and negotiations are unlikely to leave enough time (or indeed any time) for those changes to be made. This somewhat challenging zero seconds time constraint won’t just apply to government customs systems. Other government systems e.g. immigration and business supply chain and transport systems. Crucially though financial systems. If you google news about Brexit with the word ‘transition’ (i.e. a transition period to give time to implement the required changes) you will find it is nearly always financial services doing most of the crying here and it is mostly that crowd who have the treasury’s ear. The rules will change and I think part of the naiveté from many people is that they seem to believe all that is required is a change of rules. A new contract with the EU. Negotiations to arrive at those new rules. Write them all down in a new contract. Tear up the old one. Job done. But not job done. A bit more work needs doing here. The machine that civilisation now runs on is made of rules. Those rules need to be encoded in to the systems which run an economy. Civilisation runs on working code (though in many cases no one is quite sure what a lot of it does anymore lol). Finance nowadays is almost wholly composed of IT. Financial service companies do not spend their time counting physical coins and notes then arranging them in to neat little piles. So the IT systems in these businesses are somewhat prone to rule changes. And these businesses are more able to pay a higher price to get whatever work needs doing done. Obviously government IT isn’t going to be a winner in the competition for resources here so that’s the exacerbating problem.

But another thing that makes failure more likely is the apparent invisibility of this issue. This isn't in the news because of some conspiracy. The main reason it doesn’t appear in the media is largely due to the kinds of people (either for or against Brexit) involved in the public discussion. Journalists, economists, politicians, business leaders, these people do not do not do detail, they only see the ‘bigger picture’. Very few will have written a line of code ever. IT systems are rarely part of anyone’s bigger picture regardless as to how fundamental they are and for some problems if you only see the bigger picture you are not seeing the problem at all. The devil isn’t so much in the detail but a whole screaming horde of them are waiting for the gates of article 50 to open. If no one in power or no one  in the media can see or understand the problem then nothing will be done to prevent or ameliorate it. Further, those in power are unable to accept there may be problems in implementing Brexit, they only want to hear good news about the opportunities it will deliver and their underlings do not want to be the bearer of bad news for fear of being branded as against ‘the will of the people’ (there was an article in the guardian about that very thing recently).

What are the consequences of failure? A broken customs system. A system which plays a key role in co-ordinating the flow of goods through every one of the UK’s ports and airports is bust. From what we have to go on here gridlock and total chaos for however long it takes to get things fixed because there is no possibility of reverting to the ‘earlier build’ unless you go begging to the EU to be let back in. And it doesn’t take much in terms of additional delay to each container in order for a queuing system to gridlock. And it won’t take long for a gridlock on this scale to lead to some very dire circumstances. When the UK lorry strike occurred in September 2000, it emerged that due to the highly efficient just-in-time logistics hard-wired into the UK food system, supplies were an estimated 3-5 days at any one time.

The most dire consequences of a prolonged breakdown in customs IT will be to the UK food system. There isn’t anything more fundamental to the life and well being of a population than its supply of food. Obviously. This system failure will be one contribution of five in a perfect storm. The UK is 40% dependent on imports for its food. For some food stuffs you’re more dependant on imports than others particularly the good stuff for health, fresh fruit and veg. The UK exports whisky, biscuits, fat and meat. But the combined Brexit related blows to the UK food system, I’ve seen many articles on them individually but few on their combined effect, they are as follows:

1. Sterling took a hit and a rather sustained one after the referendum. So it doesn’t seem unreasonable to predict another step drop on triggering A50 and again once you actually... finally... leave. The full affect of a currency drop takes time to work through supply chains before hitting consumer prices. As stocks bought when the pound was higher run out, as currency hedge funds deplete, as the first among competing suppliers blinks and raises prices before the rest follow suit. Higher prices for imported goods over months are slowly inching their way from the price of containers at one end of the world to the prices on the supermarket shelves at the other. And that includes the price of food or at least the 40% of it the UK imports. However the homegrown 60% is not immune as costs of imported machinery fertilisers and fuel rise. Sterling has so far proven to be very sensitive to the Brexit issue, whenever it looks like the idiocy will be soft the currency goes up a little and when ever a hard idiocy looks likely it goes down. And as the penny drops that a hard brexit will be more calamitous than anyone so far has predicted then… the penny will drop even further.

2. The UK’s food system is migrant labour dependent. There wouldn’t be much UK fresh fruit and veg if it wasn’t for foreign pickers storage and distribution workers. Some crops are more labour dependant than others for example picking soft fruits like strawberries; not an easy thing for a machine to do. The restrictions that will be placed on EU citizens' ability to work in the UK will lead to a labour shortage which in turn puts a further upward pressure on food costs. The slump in currency is already making the UK a less attractive place for EU workers as they ain't getting a lot of zloty for their pound sterling like what they used to leading to... labour shortage... further upward pressure on food costs. And on top of that people aren’t too keen on having the shit kicked out of them for speaking in their own language making the UK an even less attractive place to migrate to for work, or just to visit, or even look at.

3. EU subsidies make up 55% of UK farming income. Will subsidies stay? Most pro-Brexit politicians are ideologically opposed to subsidies strongly believing in the “free market” i.e. no subsidies - if an industry fails, let it. Secondly the UK needs to negotiate new deals not just with the EU but with all the countries and trading blocs the EU had negotiated accords with on behalf of its members over the past four decades. The UK is just a tad smaller than the rest of EU (and consequently so is its bargaining strength), will be rather desperate for trade deals (because it won't have any) and a little out of practice and under resourced when it comes to negotiating such things (because the EU has been doing that work for its members). And farm subsidies might be seen by any negotiating partner as giving your industry a bit of an unfair advantage so there may be some (i.e. a lot of) pressure to drop them. So the 60% of home grown food the UK produces may take another bit of a hit when the lose of subsidies makes a lot of farms no longer a viable economic option.

4. The imposition of new tariffs but also the disruption to supply chains caused by non-tariff barriers (NTBs). NTBs such as goods inspections to check for regulatory compliance. Security checks which there may need to be more of if the UK is no longer part of the EU’s ICS. And to ensure right amount of duty is charged there now needs to be the systems and processes and infrastructure and people in place to value and determine the origin of goods (and origin checks are not a small task given stuff tends to be made of parts from a variety of places). Granted these things are already being done but aren't and haven't been done for trade between the UK and other EU countries for some decades. And given the volume of that trade this amounts to a big change, a huge new source of disruption and delay. Supply chains snake back and forth across national boundaries over the EU in many industries and food is no exception. Millions of food contracts depend on cross continental supply chains. It’s why roads are clogged with food wagons. Extra checks and administrative hurdles between the UK and EU will disrupt or even destroy many supply systems particularly so for time critical consignments like fresh fruit and veg. How will for example cabotage arrangements survive post UK exit? I just wanted to throw that word in there because I like it, cabotage. It sounds like a portmanteau of cabbage and sabotage so kind of apt.

5. The subject of this article. The disruption as a result of system failure brought about in attempting but failing to implement changes that will bring about the situation outlined in point 4. The fifth and final blow. The knockout punch.

However it gets worse. I keep reading articles and quotes about how idiots who voted for idiocy may react if they don’t get the stupidity they voted for. A related question that hasn’t been asked is this: how will those who voted against it, who have had to put up with ‘shut up and accept you lost’ and been told how wrong they are because the most dire predictions didn’t come true post referendum, told by by people seemingly unaware that those predictions were predicated on an immediate article 50 notification etc. What might the reaction be here particularly towards leave supporters if things turn out a lot worse than anyone imagined?

As the price of our beloved Bitcoin continues to rise we are seeing a barrage of new users wandering in and wondering if they too should become part of this movement. 

I've been here for a few years now; I've worked with a good number of wallets, tried my hand at mining, running nodes, comfortable with multi-sig, paper wallets, and have spent with various services such as Purse.io and direct P2P payments. I'm no expert but I've had more experience with Bitcoin than a lot of people.

**When is a good time to buy Bitcoin?**

From watching the charts it almost never seems like a good time to buy Bitcoin.

* Either the price is dropping and nobody wants to catch a falling knife; 

* The price is low compared to a previous high ""Bitcoin is dead; 70% of value gone""; 

* Or the price is surging and you want to wait for it to ""dip"" before buying in.

This is how Bitcoin has operated since its inception. There is a lot of argument by people with lots of money as to the role Bitcoin will play in the future of finance. That argument plays out as price movements. It will continue to be volatile until we reach $100k+ or bust. 

And that is a reality; Bitcoin can go bust; not likely in my opinion (or I wouldn't be here) but it is a distinct possibility that the value of our coin goes to 0.

**So when is a good time to buy Bitcoin?**

To answer that question fully you need to ask yourself, Why are you interested in Bitcoin?

**Are you simply interested in it to make some quick money because you are watching the charts?**

 If that describes you, you are not suited for Bitcoin. When the price swings violently downward you will question your life and we will have to post the suicide hotline for you. You will also be most likely to lose your Bitcoin in an exchange hack or forget your private key.

**Are you interested in Bitcoin because of its Technology, Economic, or Political ramifications?**

This is a good start; you'll be more able to handle violent price swings because your investment is not solely about money, but about supporting a new vision for the world.

**Are you interested in Bitcoin because of its Technology, Economic, or Political ramifications, and have money that you can invest for at least 4 years and afford to lose completely?**

You are the perfect candidate to own Bitcoin. Now the question is; 

**How and when does one invest in Bitcoin?**

The best method for investing in something so volatile as Bitcoin is a well known method called Dollar Cost Averaging. 

Instead of say sinking $10k into Bitcoin all at once; buy $100 worth twice a week for a year. 

If Bitcoin goes to the moon you won't make as much profit as if you put all $10k in at once.

But if Bitcoin goes down in price, you will be extremely happy with your strategy of Dollar Cost Averaging. You will end up owning much more Bitcoin with a much lower cost basis.

Now that you've decided your investment strategy and how much you want to invest you need to determine your exit strategy or contingency strategies.

Decide ahead of time the factors that would cause you to sell; and only sell when those factors are met.

For instance for me; I would only sell if technical problems became apparent in the Bitcoin network. 

However most people their contingencies will be based on the price; for instance; that you will sell X amount at Y price. Write your contingencies down and stick to them.

I do not plan to stop accumulating for another 16 years. Regardless of the price I intend to continue buying small amounts and ever increasing my holdings until ~2032. At that point if Bitcoin is still around it is very likely to be extremely valuable.

So to answer the question; 

**Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin**

**Yes**, now is as good of a time as any, but don't buy it all at once. Buy $10 worth; learn to send it, store it, retrieve it, and then buy small amounts regularly. Be willing to hold it for ideological reasons and you'll be able to weather the volatility. Then you'll be a true Bitcoin Gentlemen.

I want to know all of your thoughts on what major I should choose at tufts if I want to get into finance. I have a fairly diverse selection of clubs and classes I've been taking, but I feel pretty strongly about finance which I didn't know going into college. I have a few options of what major I should choose and also if I should transfer to a school more suited towards finance as I have a decent enough GPA so far to entertain the idea of moving laterally or maybe up. I have gotten advice that has varied from trying to differentiate myself and double major in something different like PoliSci and CompSci or do the quant Econ major which is basically just Econ plus math up to Lin alg and some more econometrics requirements. All in all, I'm interested enough to at least try pursing a major/minor in: PoliSci, math, compsci, Econ, and quant Econ. There is no finance, accounting, or statistics major at my school which makes things a little more complicated. I'm worried about math and compsci because the gpa's there are generally lower (average of below a 3.2) while I could probably do a lot better in Econ or PoliSci. What do you all of you think?"

92,2017-01-01 18:27:11,How Can China Establish an Economic “New Normal”?,"Author: Wu Jinglian, Baosteel Chair Professor of Economics, CEIBS

Published in original Chinese on November 2, 2015, Caijing Magazine

English Translation by Jesse Miller, MBA2017, CEIBS

In recent years, many people have recognized that China’s old economic model – with high-speed but inefficient growth driven by large-scale capital investment -- is unsustainable. The Chinese economy must transition to an economic “new normal”.

The Transition Will Be Difficult

To begin we must ask, what characteristics should the economic “new normal” have? In China there are many different perspectives, but overall there is an agreement on two points: First, GDP growth should shift from high speed to middle-high speed, even middle speed; second, the economic model should shift from an extensive approach relying on increasing capital investment, to an intensive approach relying on innovation. 

We should recognize that the above two points are very different in nature. For the first point, slowing economic growth is already an unalterable fact. For the second point, increasing economic efficiency, and optimizing and transforming the economic model, this has yet to be realized, and indeed it will require tremendous effort to achieve. 

Thus we face a problem: if the economy’s structure is not improved but economic growth continues to slow, then many societal problems and inequalities that were previously covered-up by high economic growth will burst into the forefront. Additionally, if the economic structure is not improved, then China’s economic growth rate will drop too quickly, and this will exacerbate existing societal problems and inequalities. Simply put, a slowdown of economic growth without an improvement of economic structure, is not the economic “new normal” we want to see. On the other hand, if economic growth slows but we are able to achieve quality economic growth, able to improve China’s economic structure, able to increase production efficiency, then we can reduce problems created by slower economic growth, and can even provide more real benefits to the Chinese people despite slower economic growth. Therefore, efficiency-based middle-speed economic growth is the economic “new normal” we desire.   

The “Three Horses” Analytical Framework Is Misleading

There are different theoretical frameworks that can be used to analyze economic policy. Different frameworks lead to different conclusions. 
	
Starting from approximately 2009, for some mysterious reason, when analyzing the macroeconomic trends in China, the most popular framework has been based on the concept that economic growth is driven by consumption, investment, and net exports, the so-called “Three Horses” of aggregate demand. According to this theory, China’s economy lacks vigor because consumption, investment, and net exports, the “three horses” of aggregate demand are not strong enough. If we can just increase the aggregate demand, then growth will return to previous levels. 

I believe this analysis has severe flaws.  

First and foremost, it simply misuses the original framework. The “three horses” analysis is a mutation of Keynesian short-run economic framework. Keynesian theory holds that the strength of aggregate demand determines the scale of aggregate supply, therefore, the overall level of output is due to society’s overall demand -- comprised of consumption, investment, and net exports. However, even though this is Keynesian theory, he only used it to analyze short-term economic issues. To take this framework and use it to analyze a long-term economic development path is obviously a mistake. 

Second, the policy conclusions that have been reached based on this framework are problematic, because at the end of the day, the demand for consumption, investment, and net exports is determined by fundamental conditions of the economy, not by people’s desires. Taking imports and exports as an example, in the end their volumes depend on the state of the entire international economy. In the past China had high levels of net exports to developed countries. This was firstly because these countries with high levels of consumption, high levels of state-welfare, and low levels of savings, saw a large gap between savings and investment, and imports from developing countries came to fill this gap; and secondly because China was a very strong low-cost competitor, and thus took a relatively large slice of the pie for net imports into developed countries.          

After the 2008 financial crisis, many developed countries de-leveraged and increased their savings rate. According to the “twin gap” model of economics, when developed countries decrease the gap between their savings and investment, it becomes less likely for developing countries to achieve positive net exports. The US savings rate will have its ups and downs, but it is unlikely to return to ultra-low pre-2008 levels. Furthermore, as China’s labor costs rise, China’s low-cost advantage will diminish, and its share of the world export pie will fall. 

Increases in consumption do not happen according to people’s wishes and desires. For example, some people say that urbanization can increase consumption, because after farmers enter the city their consumption patterns change and consumption increases. Thus they say as long we increase the rate of urbanization, the demand for consumption will increase quickly. However, this argument confuses the demand for consumption with the desire for consumption. In economic analysis, demand refers to the buying power to demand something – you need money (income) to back up your demand. So to increase the consumption demand of rural laborers, we must first and foremost increase their income. And the primary way to increase their income is by improving production methods, and increasing efficiency. Although in theory the government could give them subsidies, this would be “the wool comes from the sheep’s back”, it will not bring real prosperity.

Overall, to use the “three horses” framework every time the economy slows down results in the same conclusions – implement stimulus measures, increase money supply, start more government investment projects. 

In 2009 China implemented 4 trillion RMB fiscal spending (for two years) and 10 trillion RMB new loans, driving the short-term economic growth rate to increase. But the overall result was high government debt, excess supply of money, and a lackluster stimulus effect, leaving us with burdens that must be remedied over many years to come. After 2012, China again used government investment measures to stimulate the economy, but the positive effects are less and less, while the negative side-effects become more and more. Many people began to realize that these methods are not good.

The Three Driving Forces of Economic Development

Researching more reliable methods to drive up long term economic growth, we find three key factors: 1) labor input; 2) capital input; 3) production efficiency. 

Where did the past 30 years of high speed economic growth in China come from?

Mainly it relied on large scale capital investment. However, there were also other factors. First, there was a huge amount of newly added labor power – this is the so-called “demographic dividend” pointed out by Professor Cai of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Additionally there was another factor -- that is increasing production efficiency. China’s policy of reform and opening up greatly enhanced production efficiency. On one hand marketization reduced barriers between the cities and the countryside. Huge amounts of previously low-efficiency agricultural labor and agricultural land was transferred to cities. This sort of compositional change allowed these resources to be utilized much more efficiently. Additionally, opening up allowed China to bring in technology from overseas, quickly improving China’s production machinery, and closing the technical gap between China and developed countries at a rapid pace. In this way, after China’s reform and opening up, increasing production efficiency had a much greater contribution to economic growth than ever before.  

The problem now is that the above elements that helped to grow the Chinese economy and improve production efficiency are fading away, and some are already gone.   

First and foremost, newly added labor power’s contribution to economic growth is less and less. Professor Cai already pointed out in 2006 that according to research conducted in the past three years, the era of unlimited supply of surplus labor is ending in China. The “Lewis turning point” is already emerging. 

Furthermore, As China’s general level of technological advancement becomes relatively closer to the west, the adoption of foreign machinery and technology can no longer bring about large scale improvements in production efficiency. Professor Bai Chongen of Tsinghua University and other researchers have all reached the almost identical conclusion that starting from this century, this crucial element of improved production efficiency has begun to play less of a role in China’s economic growth, and that the future opportunity for growth in production efficiency is also diminishing. 

The basic principles of economics tell us that when potential growth from current resources and technology diminishes, and we still want to increase the short-term economic growth rate, then the only method is to implement stimulus measures. Through increasing access to credit we can “turn on the water” to the economy. But in the case of China, using stimulus measures over the long term can make the macro-economy vulnerable to the threat of bubbles and systemic risks. 

More specifically, after 2009 China has used stimulus measures multiple times, and their diminishing effectiveness is already becoming obvious. If for example we look at the 4 trillion RMB fiscal spending and 10 trillion RMB new loans in 2009, these measures were still able to bring the 2009 fourth quarter and 2010 first and second quarter GDP growth rate above 10%. However, the 2014 second quarter stimulus of 1 trillion RMB government investment only brought the growth rate from a 1st quarter growth rate of 7.4% to a second quarter growth rate of 7.5%, and by the third quarter the growth had fallen to 7.3%. The so-called “law of diminishing marginal returns” is clearly in effect

The above analysis makes it clear that the only road forward is to increase the so-called “Solow Residual”, that is the contribution of technological progress and increased efficiency towards economic growth. In other words, we need to optimize the economic structure, drive innovation, and realize a fundamental shift in the economic model from a resource-driven extensive approach to an efficiency-driven intensive approach. 

Institutional Transformation is the Foundation for Economic Transition

A new slogan or a new desire is not enough to realize a transformation of the economic growth model. From 1996 to 2000, the 9th five-year plan already pronounced this desire. However, in the majority of situations the implementation was not ideal. The root of the problem has essentially been the old economic and bureaucratic system, which has impeded attempts to change to a new model.

In 1995 when China set the 9th five-year plan, leaders for the first time expressed the need to transform the Chinese economy from a resource-driven extensive growth model to an efficiency-driven intensive growth model. In the resulting discussion, people summarized the lessons from the Soviet Union’s failed transformation attempt, and pointed out that systemic transformation is the foundation of a transformation in the economic growth model. Thus the 9th five-year plan stipulated that China must realize “two fundamental transformations”: first the economic growth model should change from relying on using resources extensively to relying on efficiency intensively, and second the economic system should shift from a planned economy to a market economy.  

Then from 1996 to 2000 during the time of the 9th five-year plan, because of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee’s decision to fully push forward comprehensive market oriented reforms, there was definite progress in transforming the economic growth model.  
	
However, when we arrived to the 10th five-year plan for 2001-2005, with the increased speed of urbanization, which was originally a good thing, under the old system led government at all different levels to greatly increase their control over land and other important resources. The government in many places then directed a wave of investment into heavy industry. Because of the government’s improper allocation of resources, transformation of the economic growth model turned backwards. 

The 11th five-year plan summarized the lessons of the 10th five-year plan, and once again placed transforming the economic growth model as a priority. However, reforms were slow during the time of the 11th five-year plan, and although we set a very good plan, there was very little actual progress to report, and in 2010, the last year of the 11th five-year plan, the party central committee had no choice but to put forward the slogan “there is no time to delay the speeding up of economic transformation”. 

Adding up the above analysis, the policy we need to adopt for the present situation should ensure that we do not increase systemic risks, and instead place our focus on systemic reforms. Only by comprehensively deepening reforms can we establish a good social and economic system, optimize the economic structure, change the economic model, and ensure an economic “new normal” characterized by middle-speed economic growth supported by high efficiency. 

Reduce and Contain Risks

Currently it is difficult to ignore the many problems in China’s macro-economy, but overall risk is manageable. As long as we implement the correct measures, systemic risk can absolutely be avoided. I believe there are many policies that we can adopt, including the following:

First, put an end to investment in low return and even no return projects. These days it is popular for people to say that we do not need to consider the returns on basic infrastructure investment projects, because the infrastructure is there, at the end of the day someone will use it. This type of reasoning is completely divorced from economics. When considering a problem in economics, an essential pre-requisite is that resources are scarce and limited. Since resources are limited, doing one project means we cannot do another, and when we make investment we are making a choice. We should only do the most effective, most necessary projects. In this regard we need to take a lesson from Japan. In 1986 Japan faced the problem of weak domestic demand, and the government initiated large scale public infrastructure investment projects to drive up economic growth. But these were large scale useless investment projects. They only helped to form the basis of the great financial collapse that followed.  

Second, use the country’s capital resources to pay back the “possibly-owed” debts. The so-called “possibly-owed” debts refer to the type of debts that are not on the asset/liability balance sheet, but that eventually will have to be repaid. Currently an obvious one is the deficit in the social insurance funds. According to calculations, social insurance plans for retired workers are under-funded by several trillion RMB. If we address this issue earlier, we can not only reduce the burden of this responsibility, but we can also create better ownership structure of state assets. Regarding this point, the decisions of the 3rd plenary session of the 18th central committee clearly stipulated that a portion of China’s state-owned capital should be appropriated to replenish social insurance. This decision should be promptly implemented. 

Third, we must stop blood transfusions to Zombie companies. Currently there are some local governments that are using loans, subsidies, tax breaks, etc. in order to prolong the life of certain companies that cannot survive. These governments are not fulfilling their important role in society -- to reduce the difficulties of workers displaced by industrial changes. Rather they are wasting resources by supporting Zombie companies to continue wasting the society’s resources. This increases the accumulation of systemic financial risk, and does not benefit the society. Japanese government took similar failed actions after their financial crash, and again we should be reminded of this lesson.

Fourth, for company’s whose assets do not support their debt levels, begin bankruptcy liquidation or bankruptcy restructuring. In this way we reduce systemic risks and make some small bangs instead of one big bang. We want to avoid accumulating system risk that might result in a big crash. 

Fifth, end the current climate in which state-backed players feel assured of a government bailout; everyone should be held 100% responsible for their own debt, this would reduce moral hazard. 

Sixth, strive to revitalize dead assets. As a result of the previous period’s excessive investment and extensive approach of growth, “dead assets” have emerged across the country. For example the “under sunshine” (no use) development zone, and sprawling rows of “ghost cities”, etc. Although it will not be easy, we still need to strive to revitalize these assets, in order to reduce leverage on the balance sheet and reduce the possibility of a recession driven by unrecoverable asset backed debt. 

In addition to the above measures to plug up holes and reduce systemic risk, we should also flexibly adjust fiscal and monetary policies in the short term. 

The combination of these two responses will allow us to ensure a stable macro-economy and avoid the emergence of any system-wide crisis. It will give us more time to implement reforms, and with reforms bringing further development we can gradually re-enter a virtuous cycle. 

Place Reform as the Topmost Priority 

In academic circles there continues to be debate as to whether comprehensive reforms can fundamentally resolve the problems we face, and whether we should prioritize the implementation of reforms over economic growth.

In my view, reforms can resolve the problem, and not only is there theoretical proof for this, but also there is confirmation from practice and implementation carried out in recent years. 

Some economists believe that China should increase government investment in order to maintain a growth rate above 8% because this will ensure a high rate of employment. A high rate of employment is certainly crucial. However, to look at the relationship between the GDP growth rate and employment rate as purely linear, and say that GDP growth must remain high in order to ensure high employment, this perspective is by no means a fixed principle. Because growth has a structural dimension, so when some industries grow 1% their employment grows by more than 1%, but when other industries grow 1% their employment barely grows at all. China’s previous growth model based on capital intensive companies with high levels of investment actually did not employ as many people as typical service companies would. So along with changes in industry composition, under the same level of GDP growth, the employment levels can be very different. Our situation over the past three years has demonstrated this very clearly. In recent years our country’s economic growth has descended step by step, but the employment rate has actually improved. To provide an example -- China’s economic growth rate has gone from 10.4% in 2010 to 7.7% in 2013, but the employment situation in 2013, and in particular the employment rate for low-skilled labor, has actually improved. According to reports from China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the original plans for 2013 called for towns and cities to grow 9 million new jobs, and in reality 13.1 million new jobs were created. In the 3rd quarter of 2014, economic growth descended another step, but the employment situation was even slightly better than in 2013. The actual situation that has played out in the past few years may not be as rosy as the statistics reported by the Bureau, but we should not doubt that overall employment situation is on a good trajectory.

Why is this happening? Mainly it is because the service industry is developing faster.

Previously, slow development of the service sector created a bottle neck for China’s overall economic growth. Our countries 11th five-year plan summarized the experience from the 10th five-year plan, and established that we must make transformation of the economic model a priority. Increased efficiency is the core of this transformation. My book, Decision Time for China’s Growth Model, discusses four key ways to increase efficiency: 

First is to turn farmers into city dwellers, educate them and make them skilled laborers. Second is to begin providing services at the two elongated ends of the production chain’s “smile curve”. Third is to develop the service sector, particularly manufacturing related services. Fourth is to use modern information technology to transform the economy; and the essence or main component of the IT industry is providing services. In summary one could say that one key point about transforming the economic growth model and increasing efficiency is to develop the service sector.

Unfortunately, the 11th five-year plan did not do this. Some regions made small progress, but some regions even regressed backwards. However, in the recent two years there has been a large change, and the service sector has begun to develop at a noticeably faster rate. Previously the manufacturing sector was always clearly leading growth, and until 2012 the service sector struggled to keep up. But in 2013 the service sector’s growth rate has increased, and it exceeded the industrial sector to become China’s largest sector.

Why is it that past governments repeatedly called for development of the service sector with little result, but in the last two years its development has suddenly improved? The reason is two reforms implemented before and after the 18th People’s Congress that have greatly advanced the service sector’s development.

The first reform started in 2012 in Shanghai, and was quickly implemented throughout the whole country -- the sales tax was replaced by a value added tax. The ministry of finance officially stated that this reform was in order to reduce the overall tax burden on companies. Currently Chinese company’s tax burden is very heavy, and indeed should be reduced, but this was not the main purpose of the reform. The reason economists proposed this reform is because they believe in Adam Smith’s principle that the division of labor is the best driver of economic growth. Because China’s sales tax double-taxed income when it was levied on total sales of companies, Rather than their value added, this created disincentives to division of labor. The value added tax only taxes the additional value added by a company, so it does not have this double taxation problem. In this way the reform benefited further deepening of the division of labor. In the service sector, for example E-commerce related services, growth in recent years became noticeably better.

The second reform started in 2012 in Guangdong, where the local government transformed its function in the critical area of corporate formation/registration, in order to make starting a company more convenient. After implementing this reform, some districts saw huge increases in new company registration. 

Currently employment statistics show one problem area, that is, recent college graduates and even recent masters-degree graduates are difficult to find jobs. Some of them end up with salaries even lower than a housekeeper. This is related to the inability of our economy to make a transformation of its economic growth model. It demonstrates that there are still issues regarding the employment situation that need to be addressed. However, overall employment levels are quite good

The above two reforms are simply a prelude to the overall deepening of reform that is needed. Although these two small reforms cannot comprehensively resolve all the distortions in our economic structure, resolve the problem of low efficiency etc, but they display a master’s finesse in making small strokes that result in large effects. They make me feel certain that the Party Central Committee’s reform strategy, when fully implemented, can resolve the problems we are facing while establishing the necessary conditions for a well-functioning system.  

Systematically and Resolutely Implement Reforms

Last year many reforms were systematically pushed forward. For example, one critical reform in the financial sector -- interest rate liberalization and exchange rate liberalization, the progress in these areas was even faster they predicted. Financial reforms are gradually being implemented. Reforms in the function of government, simplifying government and reducing bureaucracy, took their first successful steps forward. We need to make certain that these reforms are not rolled back and instead are deepened even further. Through “negative lists” regulating market entry for companies, and positive lists stating the role and rights of government, we can clarify the proper role of the government and the market in our system.

Additionally, reforms in some areas need be made even faster. 

First and the foremost, reform for parts of the economy controlled by the state should be implemented faster. This reform is crucial, but its progress is too slow. In order to resolve low efficiency problems in state-owned enterprises, the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee made many resolutions, and now we need to urgently implement these resolutions. 

One important reform was the creation of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. However some people, according to past ways of thinking, took the free trade zone as simply establishing some favorable business incentives. This is a misunderstanding of the purpose of the Free Trade Zone. President Xi Jinping stated that the main purpose of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone was to act as a mechanism for institutional innovation, to “make trade and investment more convenient”, “bring about marketization, internationalization, and a market environment with an excellent legal system and governance.” Expanding the experience gained from the Shanghai Free Trade Zone into other districts will not only help to form a more open economy with a better legal system, but also will help to unite the whole country establish a more open, competitive, and market-oriented system. 

Privately-owned businesses are the main power behind the transformation of our economic model. However, currently many business owners lack confidence and positive energy, and this is something that must be noted. We should draw on the experiences of the steps taken at the time of the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis to support private businesses. We should arrange a team to do thorough research and analysis, and put forward a comprehensive plan to address private sector confidence.    

Efficient functioning of the modern market economy is inseparably linked to government’s establishment of a good market environment and government’s proper provision of services. Currently with the high pressure against corruption, government officials no longer do a lot of improper things. However, some government officials no longer do anything at all. Previously, the secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Mr. Wang Qishan, said that the policy is to first treat the symptoms then the root cause, because treating the symptoms buys time for treat the root cause. I believe that with the high levels of anti-corruption pressure already established, we should increase the strength of combating corruption in its institutional root and “put power in a cage of law”. At the same time we should do what Premier Li Keqiang said, establish a principle that “in areas where government officials are no not given power by the law, they cannot exercise power in these areas”, and speed up the process of establishing a positive list for the functions of government officials to ensure they exercise their power according to law.

The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee’s “Decision on Important Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reforms” is already past its 2nd anniversary. Although our country’s economy faces some difficulties and pressures, as long as we correctly analyze the problems, mitigate and control risks, put the implementation of reform as our priority, and systematically and resolutely implement reforms, we will definitely be able to overcome these difficulties, create high-quality economic growth, optimize the structure of the economy, increase efficiency, and establish an economic “new normal”.

# Extended Summary:

**Breaking traditions: Ajit Doval likely to attend Donald Trump’s 'inauguration' on January 20**.

Kumar, who is in Delhi to meet senior ministers of the Modi government to help prepare a road map for Indo-US ties, particularly in the area of economics under the Trump administration also held substantial discussions with Doval on common strategic goals, including situation in South Asia and Indias extended neighbourhood.

Doval is expected to attend few events surrounding the inauguration of President-elect Trump on January 20, as a special invitee,  Kumar, also a community organiser for Trumps campaign, told ET.

During my ongoing trip, I also plan to meet Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

However, to ensure smooth flow of trade and economic growth, peace and stability is a pre-requisite in South Asia and the extended region, said Kumar, adding Delhi and Washington would strengthen their defence and security partnership under Trump Presidency that would contribute in a major way to spur economic ties.
