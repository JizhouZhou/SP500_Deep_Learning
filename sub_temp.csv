I arrived in Baghdad on the 2nd of April 2007 where my main job was to develop spending reports from the computer system used within the Ministry of Finance. 

On the 29th of May, 2007 around one hundred Iraqi police officers from the Ministry of Interior entered the building and took away myself and four British guards. 
 
For six months I was moved around meeting up with the British guards. In December of 2007 I was separated from the other Britons and was held with two Americans. In June of 2007 I was transported back to Baghdad and this was the last time I had contact with any of the other hostages.
 
In May of 2009 the number two commander of the militia (Laith Al Khazlli) was released from US custody in exchange for the bodies of two of the British guards. In September over one hundred militia were released in exchange for the body of one of the guards.
 
On the 30th of December 2009, 946 days (or 2 years, 7 months &amp; 1 day) after I was captured, I was released in exchange for the militia leader Qais Al Khazlli. The last of the hostages bodies were eventually handed over in early 2012.

Additionally, Lessig offers up some damn interesting strategies while acknowledging that it will be an incredibly difficult fight that relies not on politicians, but on citizens to challenge the status quo. 

I know this has been brought up on r/politics several times, but this dependence corruption in congress is the root of most of the problems we see with our current government. I hope campaign finance reform is an issue that will start to gain more visibility.

Edit2: WOW!!! For those of you interested GrooveCombo has created a Returners Facebook Group. All are welcome to join.  http://www.facebook.com/groups/Returners/


Edit: I wasn't going to edit this and just allow it to run without even commenting back to some of the posters here. For the uninitiated this is called ""tongue in cheek"". I would have thought that a site filled with as many trolls as Reddit would actually get it. 

This is TROLLING and YES it is, in fact, super effective against the idiotic arguments of birthers, Fox News and the Tea Party. Yes, America's political discourse is juvenile and often times retarded. We can thank our ""press"" for that and the perpetual campaigning of both parties. It's ALL manufactured. 

But, by saying nothing, doing nothing and sitting back in apathetic cynicism gets us nowhere. Arguing about shit that doesn't matter is the reason why we have the government that we do.

Over the years the Reddit community has done some truly heartfelt good for everyone from African orphans to cancer patients last wishes to the simple gifts of a car ride or couch to sleep on to coming through with Christmas gifts for kids who had nothing. No other site can make this claim. None. 

We got behind the Tea Party before it was co-opted by the GOP. We got behind Occupy before it was slandered into a bickering mess of convoluted messages. Hell we formed a freaking PAC to fight for Internet freedom. 

Still NOTHING has changed. Nothing. We are right back to where we started. Another Internet bill is lined up and another one behind that and another one behind that.

I'm 40, a husband, a father, an entrepreneur and I'm tired of the mess, so tired of it that I seriously consider leaving the US.

As for actually taking ""Returners"" and running with it. I could care less. Does it highlight absurdity and is it a good vehicle to draw attention to our idiotic political discourse? Sure. 

You want a NON-Partisan cause that everyone can get behind? Campaign Finance Reform or Congressional Reform or abolishing Electoral College or even Voting Reform are ALL noble and legitimate causes that would have direct impact on the political discourse of our day. But as with all of Reddit's other political causes it will drop from the front page and our minds with the next posting of a cute kitten. Look, squirrel....

But for once. Just one fucking time I'd like to see Reddit actually do something besides fill out an online petition or shut down a few websites. Something that has longevity and actually impacts change in this country. 

I really and truly love all of you guys but the reality is: we're going backwards and we have only ourselves to blame. Pick a fight, pick a cause and stick with it to very end. Progress doesn't just magically happen. It has to be fought for. Just ask our Founding Fathers or Martin Luther King or Gandhi. 

You have to EARN IT!!

This is exactly what I was referring to.

Automobiles, wiring, plumbing, maybe a bit of wood and metal shop, maybe even a bit of finance and cooking etc. Things that people have to do as adult automobile and home owners, but don't really get prepared for through regular schooling. Looking at the responses, it seems as though it varies by area whether or not these classes are available, but I'd love to see them more widely offered."

13,2012-03-15 09:42:08,"We Know Congress is Broken. We Know Money is Corrupting Government. Reddit, let's organize and do something about it. ","I just finished reading Lawrence Lessig's *Republic, Lost*, a great read for anyone interested in campaign finance reform, and the takeaway from it is this: in order to achieve any measurable change in the way Washington works, reform must come from the grassroots level through ordinary citizens. He goes on to say that the best way to achieve this end is to have a constitutional convention, with delegates sent from each state to discuss important issues of reform. For those who are skeptical, the right to a constitutional convention is outlined in Article V of the Constitution, and there is a convention structure that could be used for such a scenario. There would, of course, be necessary conditions which must be established beforehand, such as needing at least 20 states to agree on an issue for it to be discussed at the convention, and prohibiting sitting members of Congress from being a delegate. I know this sounds insane, and I know it seems futile, but it isn't as hopeless as it sounds. This movement will happen state by state, starting at the local level. We have to remember that change at the group level is only possible because of the actions of INDIVIDUALS. I strongly encourage everyone concerned about the state of our political system and campaign finance to check out [Rootstrikers](http://rootstrikers.org/), and [Public Campaign](http://www.publicampaign.org/) to learn more about and pledge support for campaign finance reform. Furthermore, there will be a conference on SEPTEMBER 24th [at Harvard University to discuss organizing for a Constitutional Convention](http://www.conconcon.org/). If we want things to change, we have to take action. The first step is to raise awareness, and the second is to organize and push for a Convention. This task may seem daunting, but it will require very little action from each individual, yet we know one small action taken by many leads to big change. Let's get aggressive on this, I know we are capable of it, Reddit. Congress is not serving the people, they are following the money. All it takes to stop this is The People making a stand. What are we waiting for? 

TL;DR There is a movement to hold a Constitutional Convention to address government reforms such as Campaign Finance. Let's spread the word and join the movement. 

Edit: To clear up some confusion, this is not simply the same thing as Occupy, although it embodies similar elements. This is a movement to hold a Convention that would DIRECTLY put Constitutional amendments up to the States for a vote.

I am a reporter for ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization. Twitter: [@kim_barker](http://twitter.com/Kim_Barker)

I cover campaign finance, focusing mainly on “dark money” groups, the social welfare nonprofits that spend millions on political ads and don’t disclose their donors. (Think Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity.) While I also write about super PACs, super PACs have to report their donors. Before coming to ProPublica, I was the Edward R. Murrow press fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. There, I wrote a book about my five years covering the war on terror, pinballing between Afghanistan and Pakistan for The Chicago Tribune. It’s called “The Taliban Shuffle,” and it’s written with a dark sense of humor. (Occasionally, I bring the funny to campaign finance, but that’s more of a challenge.)

IWAE (I Won’t Answer Everything). No questions about a certain former Pakistani prime minister, for example, and since I don’t really focus on the individual candidates and their fundraising, I’m not the best person to ask about that particular horse race. But on dark money, I’m your person.

18,2012-01-31 10:32:57,SOPA? PIPA? How about we address the root of the problem: Campaign Finance and Lobbying,"So, the reaction to Sopa and Pipa from the internet was pretty amazing right? It's incredible what people can do when we all come together. Makes me think we can accomplish even more.

When the head of the MPAA openly threatened Obama, we got a brief glimpse of the source of the issue. He said: ""Candidly, those who count on quote 'Hollywood' for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake.  Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.""

This is someone who is not afraid to openly flex his power: his control over campaign contributions.

This, to me, is the source of the majority of problems.  It was the cause for the banking bailout, and it is the cause of the current multi-pronged attack on the internet.

Our politicians unfortunately exist within a system that requires them to seek funding from outside sources.  If you don't, you fall behind and will not get elected.  Those that do, often find themselves either indebted to those that funded their campaign, or they find that the majority of their resources and influence lie with the same people.

The solution: Make campaign contributions over 100 dollars illegal.  This is not an easy task, especially because money now = speech, and limiting that would be limiting free speech.  The argument to remove it needs to come from the imbalance: people who have more money have more rights and access to more speech, it is not democracy.

So first things first, getting the supreme court to recount on the idea that money is free speech. We use examples, we put the word out there as much as possible, and make this issue toxic for anyone who supports it. It can be done.

Then, we focus our energies on the next election. Make the hinging issue on who is going to promise to limit campaign contributions.  Obama has spoken about this before, but we need more than that, we need action. Sure, its not just within his power to up and create a law like that, so its going to take more than just convincing him. 

I know, I know, I am simplifying things. Easier said than done, right?  Well It has to be said. You are upset with this economy? You are upset with corporations having too much power, and laws being passed against the better interest of the people? This is the problem. The sooner we get the public eye onto this, the better.

This video had a big impact on me (long, and on economics, but rational and important):

http://vimeo.com/35369616

The key here is to be rational, and truthful when spreading this. We can create a meme, but have it founded in real evidence, without exaggeration.  The most powerful part of the SOPA/PIPA protests for anyone I asked were the Khan Academy video that just explained exactly what it was in a simple manner.  This approach can work, we can bring attention to existing organizations trying to achieve the same goal.

Thoughts? Discussion? Ideas? Am I full of shit?

20,2012-08-28 03:14:26,Administrator rights to everything (PT 2),"So, this morning has been an interesting morning so far. I was checking my reddit inbox and reading some suggestions with how to deal with the demon receptionist from the seventh floor of hell. 

Today I was nice:

Receptionist: Hey X, I'm having trouble seeing a document, can you come and help.

Me: Yeah, sure thing.

*Walk over to her desk and see an 'Access denied' message on a sharepoint document.

Me: Oh, I see. What document are you trying to see? 

Receptionist: Nothing special, I just need it to work.

Me: Sure thing, can you send me a link to the document please?

Receptionist: No, I've lost it. 

*I can see a filename and web address written on a post-it note on her desk, and I jot it down in my notepad*.

Me: Not a problem, let me see if I can get you access to the file.

Receptionist: Thanks.

*Back at my desk, checking what the file was. Turns out she was trying to access her husbands previous paycheck (assumption of filename, GW Payroll July), god only knows where she found the link for it. Back to her desk we go.*

Me: Hello. I've found out what the problem is. The file you are trying to access isn't allowed to be accessed from your department, only from finance, and I can't view it myself either.

Receptionist: But you can give me permission to see it, right?

Me: Yes, and no. I can give permission, but it would be invasion of privacy and a security breach. I'd be in trouble, and I cannot give permissions, sorry.

Receptionist: It is really important that I see this document, it is for my work.

Me: Unfortunately, I am unable to give permissions. If it is for your work, you can contact finance department and they can contact me. As far as I understand, your account allows all access to the files you need.

Receptionist: This is stupid, this is why you should have given me administrator access.

Me: Uhmmm...

Receptionist: I shouldn't need to ask to see company files. I work here.

Me: Hey, but...

Receptionist. You should just do your job. You are the computer guy, go do the computer stuff so I can do my job.

*That feel of rage, but advised to be subtle*.

Me: I understand that your job can be difficult, and mine can be too. For this reason I will need to contact Mr.Boss and speak with him about granting access for you. I'll happily oblige.

Receptionist: That isn't necessary, just click on my name and click ok. That's all you need to do.

*Her manager is walking past*.

Me: Hey derp, can you help us.

Derp: Sure. 

Me: Receptionist is having a problem here, she can explain it a little for you.

Receptionist: I don't have access to a file.

Derp: Oh, ok. X can simply fix it, right?

Me: I sure can. Let me go back to my desk and allow her access to the finance documents so she can view anyones payroll whenever she pleases. 

Derp: Wait, what?

Me: Receptionist, your husbands payroll document will be working for you in around 5 minutes when the server adjust to the changes (i lied, it changes instantly) so you will have to wait until then. Also, while Derp is here, can we book a time so we can speak about the Administrator privileges you need?

*Derp glaring at the Receptionist*

Me: I'm free after 2pm. Is that good for you?

*Receptionist with mouth open in shock*.

Derp: Yes, 2.30pm would be ideal. Receptionist husband should be present also.

And boom went the dynamite. Fellow redditors were a bit annoyed with me for calling her ""Just a fucking receptionist"". 

If that was bad, was this win? I won't be posting what we speak about in entirety, but the outcome will be posted.

I look at it, and it's the dongle/receiver for her wireless keyboard. I laugh and tell her ""This is probably the problem.""

23,2012-05-15 11:24:29,A list of things I have learned from R/Frugal,"First time posting here, although I've been reading this subreddit for some time now. Because my work is tied to a university, I have a (forced) month off. My wife and I are buying a house, so I have been taking stock of our current practices and planning future frugal ideas.
Here are some of the tips and plans for saving money that I have gathered from this subreddit:

**–Cook good and healthy food for less:**
Fruggit has been wonderful in promoting this. Crock-pots/Slow-cookers are your friend. So are dried beans, good quality bulk rice, and many other frugal options. I've found http://budgetbytes.blogspot.ca/ to be very helpful. I've also found that one of the grocery store around me (in a much lower income area) stocks roughly the same items as the other stores, but never sells some of the nicer items. (organic items, good cheeses, etc) When they get close to the end of the shelf life, the store discounts then by 50% to get them off the shelves. Because of this I've adjusted my purchasing schedule to shop there 1-2 times a week, buying fresh fruits/veggies/etc and whatever is dramatically discounted, and then plan meals around this.

**–Get a chest freezer:** 
Gives you the space to take advantage of really cheap food deals, as well as allows you to buy more things in bulk. We will be buying one as soon as we move into our house. (BTW: Lowes always has 10% off coupons in the post office's new address forms. This turns a $200 7 cu. ft. freezer into a $180 one)

**–Get a cheaper cell phone plan:** 
This is a hard one for me. My wife has 22% off at Verizon, and I use my smart phone more often then I use a computer. (which I use ALL the time) With factoring in what the cost of a new high end smartphone would cost, it's still cheaper to get off the Verizon plan, so we likely will switch when our contract is us in 6 months, but it's only a savings of $7-$10 a month. I need to make sure that the coverage and extra features of a pre-paid phone plan are worth it.
However, as a rule pre-paid plans have always been cheaper. I had one for 2 years before I got a contract phone. (needed reception at school, Verizon has the only tower)

**–Make your own laundry detergent:** 
It only took me about an hour to make a powdered detergent from Borax, Washing Soda, and Bar Soap. (1 cup, 1 cup and ½ bar respectively) 
There are tons of recopies. [This is the one I used](http://www.diynatural.com/homemade-laundry-detergent-soap/) Rough cost estimates for me were 900 loads for ~$20. Cheapest equivalent was Aldi's detergent at 360 loads for $25.

**– Look for cheaper means of transportation:**
With each of us having jobs, as well as things like grad school, non profit board meetings, and after school tutoring programs it's not yet been practical for us to move down from two vehicles. I have long fantasized about owning a moped/scooter that's under 50cc  so I could get rid of my terrible car (which with some DIY mechanical work I have somehow kept running) and have an insurance/title free vehicle along with a main car. This may never happen, but would provide a significant amount of savings. We also don't have a good means of public transit.

**–Brew your own alcohol: (Well... at least beer and wine...)**
[r/Homebrewing](http://reddit.com/r/homebrewing) is awesome. I've just started testing the waters of brewing with some 1 gallon test batches of apfelwein. (apple wine) Ciders and meads don't usually require boiling, so there is less initial equipment to purchase, but even for making beer, after the ~$150 initial purchase, your batches will run between $20-$40 for 50-60 bottles of beer that's better than from the store. It's not for everyone, but it's a hobby I'm interested in, and will save money in the long run.

**–Start putting into place energy efficient items in your house:**
I've read countless good ideas for this. Here are a few: 
Smart power strip for TV set ups(Saves about $12/yr) 
 CFL bulbs, 
Water saving shower heads (already using so it won't be an adjustment)
Water Saving Toilet systems: Dual Flush Kit (Or even putting a 2-liter filled with water into your tank to reduce water usage. I like having the full/half flush option)


**–Don't pay for cable, and buy a modem instead of renting one:**
I will have to use Comcrap cable services for internet because they are the only thing in the area. I will definitely buy a modem (it will cost about $40) instead of renting one for $5 a month.
Instead of a cable package get a Roku player (~$50-$60 if you look for a cheap model refurbished or on sale, there are plenty of similar items you could get instead) with your choice of Hulu Plus/Netflix/Amazon prime video. 
Assuming Comcast doesn't play the “force you to bundle with a 'basic cable' package of over-the-air channels for a dollar or two more than just internet which you're not allow to buy ala carte” game, I will also buy a HDTV antenna. [r/cordcutters](http://reddit.com/r/cordcutters) is a great place for information. 

**–Restore or build your own furniture:**
I've recently started getting my feet wet in some DIY projects. ([r/DIY](http://reddit.com/r/DIY) is a great as well) I build a headboard for our bed for under $50. A friend gave us a large wooden spool that my wife and I are going to convert into a table/bookshelf combo. With a few tools, and some time you can save hundreds of dollars and have the satisfaction of building things yourself.

**– Exercise outside of a gym:**
Paying for a gym membership in my opinion can be a frugal option if it makes you exercise, (so many benefits from exercising... I need to do it more) but it's very easy and totally free to go for a walk/job/run outside, and from just a monetary perspective it will save you tons of health care money down the road.

–(For those who have a good handle on their spending) **Use a rewards credit card instead of a debit card:**
I fully understand this is not a good idea for some people. I could tell you several of my friends who I would specifically recommend to not use a credit card. However, in my situation, where I have great mutual accountability between me and my wife, the $300 sign-up bonus and the 1-5% cash back on purchases has been a nice source of extra money, and hasn't increased our spending at all.

**– Use Open-office and Google Docs instead of Microsoft Office:**
While some people need the extra features that Microsoft Office provides (Such as Excel... can't really get a comparable substitute), it amazes me that many people I know do not take advantage of these free and powerful alternatives to a $100 software package.

**– Get your personal finances in order:**
To echo what seems to be the mantra of [r/personalfinance](http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance): Get out of debt, Save up a 6 month emergency fund, max out an employer matched 401K plan, then start investing in indexed mutual funds. Make the money you've saved work for you.
I think Scott Adam's (Dilbert Cartoonist) 9-point plan to personal finance is an easy and clear way that explained the basics tenets of personal finance

This version isn't as volatile, but hopefully retains the gist of the sentiment, while further explaining some of the muddier details.*

As a film student in early 2001, I was a juggernaut.  I was making a lot of short films that were garnering moderate acclaim, and I was always pushing ahead, making bigger and bigger projects.  For my senior thesis, I wanted to base it on a short story by Isaac Asimov, which was part of the compilation that made up the book “I, Robot”.  Isaac had died a few years previous, but after a lot of badgering to the publishers, I was finally awarded with the home phone number of his wife, Janet.

I figured that the number I was given was just another publishing associate, so I dialed with thinly veiled skepticism.  To my surprise, the voice that answered was a feeble, elderly woman.  I struggled through my initial shock to explain that I was a student; I wanted to use her husband’s story as a basis for my project, and could I get her permission.  She said that it sounded like fun, and gave me the number of the estate attorney, so I could get a written form that gave me the go-ahead.  I called, I got permission, and they faxed the form to my professor’s office.

*It’s important to note that the film was based on one of Asimov’s short stories, “Reason”, but was not a direct interpretation.  It was not titled “I, Robot”, and barring the inclusion of the laws of robotics, was almost wholly original.* 

2 weeks later, 30 people showed up to help build sets, sew costumes, and make a little bit of history.  **Sadly, I let them all down.**

In our last week of shooting, 3 months after I received written consent to use the short story, one of the crew brought in a copy of Variety, which mentioned that a major studio purchased the book rights to I, Robot, and planned to make a film.  Initially, I thought, “Awesome – free promotion!”  Alas, that’s not what was looming on the horizon.

Part of the project was to make posters, trailers, and a website for the film.  We even went so far as to create our own production company, as to look professional.  Somehow the legal team from the studio found out about a student project, in a small private college in the Midwest, with no budget, being shot in a warehouse basement, and decided to issue a cease and desist order.  Basically, what that means, is that the studio’s lawyers said to us, “You’re using our property.  Stop, or we’ll sue you into the stone age.”  I responded by sending them the consent form from the Asimov estate, and explained that it was a student project, not a commercial venture worth litigating.  I turned over our script, our shooting notes, our shot list, copies of our tapes and even the concept art drawings.

Instead of the letter recognizing our valiant efforts as students that I expected, I found myself on the tail end of a phone call that changed my life.  I was contacted directly by the lead of the studio’s legal team, who explained my situation to me very clearly.  He told me that I was technically in my legal right to use Isaac Asimov’s material.  However, if I chose to proceed, they would file multiple lawsuits totaling over 2 million dollars against me.  In the end, I might win, but it would take hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to fight it, but would cost them nothing more than the salaries they already pay their lawyers.  It would be 10 years before any type of verdict could be levied, and by then it wouldn’t matter what the outcome was, since their film would be long since released.

I was 22.  I was working 2 jobs, making about $9 an hour, in addition to attending school.  I had taken out every student loan I could get to finance my film, which totaled about $10,000 in debt.  I had spent my last dollar to buy breakfast for the crew on the last day of shooting.  I was properly fucked.  *I caved.*

In the end, my professors had sympathy on me.  They had visited the set, seen the dailies, and recognized my talent and dedication.  I graduated with honors, without ever turning in a senior thesis project.  I guess that they assumed I had learned the most valuable of all life lessons.

Looking back, I can recognize that the lawyers were only doing their job; I was only worth a couple of hours of an intern’s time, and a 10 minute phone call.  To me, they completely pulled the rug out from underneath the career that I’d been trying to carve out for myself.  Without a thesis project, I wasn’t equipped to apply to grad schools, and by the time I’d recuperated from the costs I’d incurred, I’d already been forced to accept a different career path, and rearranged my life to fit.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a fairly successful career designing web sites for major entities, and I make a decent living.  I was willing to pick up and start over, but I can’t help but harbor resentment for having my wings clipped so early, and so unjustly.

It’s been ten years since this all went down, and even though I want to share my film, show my work and risk the consequences, I cannot.  As my wife reminded me, we have a home, careers and our livelihoods.  I’m not just putting myself in harm’s way, but her as well, and that’s not a fair sacrifice regardless of the honest intentions.  *Please note that I don't condone any illegal activity of any sort.*

My story is not unique, nor is it very interesting.  I’m one of many that have had a short end of the stick handed to them by a big faceless monster, and I feel that it’s my right and responsibility to take that short bit and fight back - *one download at a time.*

I’m forced to watch the studios systematically destroy the art of film.  *One download at a time.*

I defy the system in my own petty way.  *One download at a time.*

I want to watch it burn.  *One download at a time.*

Some of you saw a portion of the film clip, and I want to thank everyone for their kind sentiments.  However, by posting it, I might have been in violation of the original cessation order, so I had to unfortunately take it down of my own volition.  I’m forced to consider that my actions no longer affect only myself, but my family, my company, and my employees, and am no longer in a position to make a stand and risk their futures, as well as my own.

I am deeply inspired by the support that has been shown by the reddit community, so much so that I’ve begun to rekindle my efforts to recreate this film since it not only holds a lot of personal sentiment for me, but is an incredibly timeless tale that deserves its’ due.  Sadly, I cannot use any of the original footage, pursuant to the legal action that was brought against me.  Luckily, like so many of you have stated, it’s not too late to start over.  Please send messages to me directly, since the comments in these posts have taken on a life of their own, and have become very difficult to follow.

**Thank you again**, reddit, for providing insight and support into something that has been hanging over my head for a decade.  Thank you for helping find my voice again, and for the inspiration that I sorely needed a long time ago.

FU (Finance User):  Tom come here quick someone is trying to get control of the PAYROLL PC!!!

The payroll PC is a network connected but not domain connected PC that basically runs Sage Payroll and nothing else.  We do not have the passwords for it (I know, I know) and we do not have VNC/RDP access either.

So being a very important PC I go right over the other side of the school to have a look.  Upon arrival I see the finance manager sitting there in panic, on the phone.

FU:  Look at this pop up it says someone wants access to control the PC!!

Me:  (Looks at LogMeIn session open on screen)  That is correct, but you have to initiate that session, its not auto-magic.

FU:  Well I am on the phone to Sage support.

Me:  Have they requested access to the PC.

FU:  Yes.

Me:  So you rang a support line, they have requested access to the PC, you have downloaded and initiated the software and session, and it pops up a warning about someone taking control.

FU:  Yes.

Me:  Do you want them to get control?

FU:  Yes.

Me:  So click Yes.

FU:  OK, thanks...

He makes it clear he doesn't want the child, and can't financially support it, and offers abortion or adoption as an alternative to paying for the child, yet the mother can still make the sole decision to raise it herself. Should she then have sole responsibility to finance her investment? Why should the father be burdened by the mother's selfishness?

Obviously if the mother didn't want the child, and the father did, she could easily abort it without his consent. It's her body, and I think it should be her decision to go through with it for either adoption by the father or adoption by a third party, but as far as keeping it, it just doesn't seem logical men should have to pay half of their paycheck for two decades because of someone else's decision, despite the man's efforts to forfeit financial responsibility before it comes a burden.

All because the mother had the sole decision to refuse adoption."

34,2012-12-28 13:03:40,"I am about to tell you something reddit, something I have never told another person. WARNING: Lots of text!","When I was eighteen years old I got my very first job at a video retail store called I will not name. It was probably my favorite job I've ever had. In 2001, I stole my very first DVD which was ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp (side note: TERRIBLE MOVIE). I stole it by taking it into the employee bathroom, slicing it open with a razor, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, first). Why did I do this? I wanted to see the movie, it looked interesting in the previews and I didn't have the money to purchase it (at the time, my parents forced me to deposit my paychecks into a savings account… all of it, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing, I just really wanted to see the movie so I took it. No thought of ""stealing is wrong"" entered my head. I know it's wrong in the sense of the law, but for some reason, I did not care. This kind of stealing evolved the next couple of years when I got a few of my friends involved. Usually it would go like this:

* Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager.
3:30pm, the General Manager would go on a conference call in the back room for a mandatory one hour meeting.
* During this time, I would call in my friends and they would collect all of the DVDs they wanted, bring them to the counter where I was working, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted.
* Once completed I would do a ""fake transaction"" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card.
* After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my ""bag"" at a later time.

This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, it was a good feeling for me that I had amassed such an impressive collection of films. You're probably wondering if my parents noticed this collection. To be quite honest with you, I am not sure. I kept my collection really well hidden at first, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it.

At the store I worked in, one had the ability to reserve a DVD if it was set to be released in the future. One customer in who I will call Cornelius, was some rich guy who used to come in and order them by the dozens and pay for them in full. I was his favorite employee since we had similar tastes in films and I liked to hear about his exploits in his business (he was a high ranking ""problem solver"" for some world-wide corporation). So he used to always reserve films when I was at the register (this also helped keep me employed there since employees had a quota that needed to be filled). One day, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. 

Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared ""Cash or credit"", so when I hit cash, the register opened and I was able to give him money back. After this instance, the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause.

My General Manager only checked the cash totals, he didn't even count up the credit card totals to make sure those were correct. He also had a list of reservation certificates redeemed (the ones that I will soon use to take money out of the register) that he just signed off on that he checked and they were ok. After that, he would rubber band all of the reports together, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. 

So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, usually for the amount of 49.99 and then using that to redeem an equally fake 29.99 DVD so I'd get an easy $20. It should be noted that there was no real way to inventory reservations since you could redeem these tickets at ANY OF THE STORES IN THE USA. Just like my DVD stealing scam I still had going, this evolved from me doing the $20 scam I just described to a whopping $120 scam every shift I worked.  I worked there five days a week since I sold the most reservations. Sometimes I would do two $120 scams in a row. The $120 scam was me redeeming a $120 reserve on a $1.00 bottle of pop we had in the store. At the end of the night, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34,000 a year in addition to the measly $6.50 an hour I was receiving. 

You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, someone HAD to have seen me pocket all of this money!! I only really did this when the store of devoid of customers (which was frequent back in 2003/2004) and honestly, my General Manager was not an intelligent man. He was a very nice guy, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall.

Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything, it's a serious problem I have but it is beneficial in certain things. Such as my work scams. There were times I wanted to stop the cash scam because I knew I would have been found out inevitably (just not very quickly) but the money was too good and I was an underachiever in my youth. So I started to develop a contingency plan should the inevitable day come where I am caught. I actually was interview by the Loss Prevention Detective for the company about a year prior to my scam being found out over something unrelated. So I saw how the man conducted himself in the interrogation, however I knew he was not looking for me. I researched how interrogators work and their various tactics to get criminals to ""crack."" One of the most commonly used techniques is the ""Loaded Question Tactic."" I will attempt to explain:

A loaded question is a question  which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. , a presumption of guilt). Loaded questions are logical fallacies in themselves and typically used as rhetorical tools: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda.

Example:

The question ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you have a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question is loaded.

Since this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct answers:
	1. ""Yes, I have stopped beating my wife"", which entails ""I was beating my wife.""
	2. ""No, I haven't stopped beating my wife"", which entails ""I am still beating my wife.""
	
The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say ""I have never beaten my wife."" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, we did not have personal codes when ringing up something in the register, it was just open to anyone to use so you couldn't personally track who rang what. I knew it would be easy to connect the dots once I was found out but it would still be circumstantial without a confession. So without further adieu, let me explain how this came to an end for me.

October 19, 2004, I made a grave mistake when I was at work. I needed some extra cash so I could go on a trip to Minnesota with a few friends. It was unusually busy (there were three big releases that week if I remember correctly), and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect, I should have taken it anyway because a $120 overage is loads more suspect than a shortage (think about it) but I opted to leave it. 

At the end of the night, sure enough, the drawer was $120 over and my General Manager was freaking the fuck out. But to my surprise he didn't troubleshoot by checking the report… he still signed off on EVERYTHING and figured he'd just get ""yelled at and it would blow over."" So I was naturally relieved by his ignorance. I had the next day off, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said ""No."" But it wasn't a suspicious ""no."" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work.

He didn't say anything out of the ordinary to me when he was done with his paperwork, except I noticed he actually checked the reservation redeems and but a BIG question mark around it. Also, I requested the next few days off (about a month beforehand) I didn't tell them where I was going or what I was doing. If I remember correctly, I phrased it as I had to work on a school project (I'm not that dumb) but I was really going to Minnesota on a fishing trip. After three days passed, I came back to work and ohhhhhh man were things instantly different. This other part-time employee looked SCARED TO DEATH at the register so I asked her what was wrong. She told me a loss prevention detective was in the store and he wanted to interview every employee. I played it off like everything was ok, but I knew… I knew this was the day I was mentally preparing for… the inevitable interrogation. So I clocked in and went about my work routine when suddenly the General Manager comes out of the office and pulls me aside and tells me I need to talk to the LP Detective. I ask what it's about, and he just says ""he wants to talk to everyone."" But I knew, I was the main event for this LP Detective. 

I'm basically SHOVED into the backroom and this Cliff Huxtable sweater wearing guy smiles at me, introduces himself, and politely asks me to sit down. His opening statement went something like:

LP Detective: Hell there tweakofnature, I'm (I forgot his name), I work for the Loss Prevention Department of (whatever the corporations name was that owned the store I worked in). I'm here today conducting an investigation and I just need some basic information from you.

He asked me my full name, date of birth, and how long I worked for the store. I answered him truthfully.

He then asked me my personal definition of theft. To which I answered ""Taking something that doesn't belong to you.""

Meanwhile, as I am looking around the room, there are numerous old reports sprawled about with my cash scam transactions highlighted. Also several old employee schedules attempting to link me. I knew he was trying to fuck with me at this point, he knew it was me, he just needed me to say so otherwise he didn't have a case (gotta love that word ""circumstantial"")… so I decided to play right back. Normally, the interrogator will ask personal questions such as ""what you aspire to be?"" Normally the perp would answer honestly and then the questioning would take a more negative turn in an attempt to break the suspect for example:

He did ask me: ""So what did you aspire to be when you were young?"" (career wise)

If I had answered honestly with "" I wanted to be a filmmaker"" he most likely (speculative on my part) would have taken the questioning to either ""Looks like you just didn't cut it, right?"" or ""You probably need a lot of money to finance a film.""

Instead, I chose a different route, one to aggravate this man. I simply answered his questions WITH QUESTIONS. It went like this for a while:

**LP Detective** : What did you aspire to be?

**tweakofnature** : How long have you worked for (store name)?

**LP Detective** : Have you ever stolen anything before?

**tweakofnature** : Have you ever given anything away before?

**LP Detective** : Do you ever get angry?

**tweakofnature** : Have you ever been happy?

He starts to get real irritated with me and accuses me of not being cooperative, to which I apologize for making him mad (which pisses him off more). Now here's where the Loaded questions come. He literally phrased it like this:

**LP Detective**: ""tweakofnature, I'm going to ask you a loaded question, do you know what that is?""

(I lie and say I don't)

**LP Detective**: ""It's just like a normal question, but it's one that I already know the answer to!""

**tweakofnature**: Ok…?

**LP Detective**: ""Have you committed any form of theft this week?""

Here are the facts up to this point:

* All of the evidence he had against me was entirely empirical and circumstantial; nothing concrete.
* No one witnessed me doing these things I was being accused of.
* He could connect the dots and see that the same dollar amount was taken on only days that I worked leading to a conclusion that it was most likely me, but alas; no concrete evidence… just conjecture.
* I was always quiet and kept to myself at work, I never told anyone (not even my best friend) what I was doing. Most of the time when people steal money, they gloat about shit they bought with it. I knew that was not a smart move so I said nothing.
* The General Manager and the Assistant Manager were in financial turmoil at the time, and I knew I could pawn the investigation onto them.

I told the LP Detective… YES! That I had committed theft that week. He looked surprised by my admission of guilt. He then asked ""Could you describe what you did."" I told him ""I stole three DVDs"", and went on to tell him that ""I knew that secret shopper spotted me and I've felt guilty ever since^1."" His demeanor changed to what I can only describe as horrific confusion. He tripped over his words and said ""Oh… okay, okay!"" He asked me if that was my first time and I said yes because they cut our hours (which was true) and I had to cut corners in my budget.

It was obvious he did not want to pursue this petty theft and wanted to bring the conversation back around to the cash scam. So he asked ""Thank you for your honesty, tweakofnature, now have you done any other types of theft?"" I asked him what he meant, and he said ""Did you ever maybe take any money out of the drawer?"" (notice: I mind-fucked him in such a way he forgot about the loaded questions). I told him never and that it was impossible, WOULDN'T THE DRAWER BE SHORT??? Then this stupid asshole decided to explain my own cash scam to me and I just pretended like I didn't understand it. He tried placating and ego I didn't have by saying ""If you think about it, this scam is rather ingenious!"" I just kept telling him I didn't understand how it could work. So he explained it probably three times and that's when I brought up ""Wouldn't this have shown up on a report?"" His face went to hard scowl and he just said ""maybe someone wasn't doing their job correctly.""


So now he tries scaring me by describing these hidden cameras they sometimes put into stores that are the size of a pin head. Before he even finished I flat out asked him ""Do you have me on video doing this?"" and he responds ""Are you sure you want me to answer that?"" DUMBEST THING YOU COULD HAVE SAID SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, you might as well have said no. So I answered sarcastically with ""Yes, I want to see something impossible."" He gives me another scowl… this mother fucker is losing the battle, and he knows it. He ends up calling the police to report my theft and exits the back room telling me not to leave.

He ends up coming in and out of the backroom intermittently trying to get me to confess to the money scam, but I remain tight lipped. Eventually the Police show up and ask where the merchandise is that I allegedly stole. They thought it was this big box of DVDs on the ground (we had a new shipment that needed to be put out on the floor). When the LP Detective told them that it wasn't the Cops stood there confused. This LP Detective didn't even have me write anything down or sign anything, however I did personally confess to him, but he couldn't prove it.

After arguing with the cops, they pretty much tell him that they can't arrest me without some form of evidence. He tells them that I confessed, but ardently deny confessing anything and accuse him of trying to wrap up an open LP case. Eventually the cops tell him that they aren't arresting me and criticize how he does his job. Completely embittered and defeated, the LP Detective takes one look at me and tells me to leave the store and never come back. To which my reply was only: ""But why? I didn't do anything wrong!""

His face turned bright red, I got up from my seat and exited the store and I never returned.

I heard several months later he was terminated (not because of me) because he royally fucked up another interrogation at a different store.

I apologize if there are any grammar/spelling errors. Once I started typing, I simply could not stop. Thank you for reading.

^1 - I did that solely to fuck with him. He wasn't recording anything I was saying but merely writing it down. And if he wanted me to sign anything I would have refused and requested a lawyer.

**TL;DR** : I stole over $30,000 from a retail job I had in 2003/2004 and after I was caught I outsmarted everyone and got away scott-free

My position at the new firm isn't really defined but essentially I am the only economist/finance guy in the firm and my job will be to keep my bosses up to date with whats happening money-wise. Currently, there is a secretary who does everything and is suppose to get me up to speed before she leaves in 2 weeks. She spends most of her time with emails and phone calls which the boss has made clear I won't be doing so I don't want to get in her way.

To make a long story short, I've been here for almost 10 days and I'm starting to feel a bit useless. My question is: I know eventually there will be plenty for me to do but for now, is it normal to do almost nothing in the beginning and wait for the boss to give me assignments or should I try to involve myself more? 

**Edit1;** Just to clarify, I'm not complaining that I have no work nor am I avoiding work. I just felt like there was literally nothing for me to do and that talking to the secretary wouldn't change that. I wanted to see if anyone else felt like this when they started working.

**Update1;** Thanks to everyone who read, upvoted or downvoted and especially to those who took the time to comment. I will try to reply to as many as I can throughout the week. It's only been a day since I posted this and I've already been given things to do/finish. I guess I sort of panicked after being useless for the first week. 
If anybody clicked the thread because they feel the same way, read the comments, there is a lot of insight and very smart suggestions."

Hi. I'm Raem Civrie, and I played this stupid game for years and years. I saw some shit in my capacity as Chronic Close Observer of Big Events, and hereby do my best to illustrate some of it for later arrivals. Dates are fuzzy, and some facts may be as well, because this is from memory and my memory is the worst thing.

--

Back in 2000, I was 14 years old and a little tit, an attribute that I would stubbornly hold on to for way too long. But 2000 was also the year I learned about EVE-Online, then three years away from release and little else than a barebones website, some forums, an IRC channel and fevered promises by a bunch of crazy people in a cramped office.

Oddly enough, the first corporation ""founded"" in EVE was back then, somewhere around October/November 2000 named ""North Star Industries"", and by virtue of being first in through the door I would end up being a part of the Triumvirate ""leading"" some 50 people waiting for a game whose eventual existence was anyone's guess. It was the first of many meaningless titles I would cherish down the road. I'd later ""found"" an espionage-focused corporation called Horizon Industries. Of course, this was all the most vacuous roleplay you can imagine, characterized by play-fights on the forums and endless competing for the ""coolest"" signature images and websites. But I was a bored teenager and I didn't have anything better to do.

Alpha rolled in, and being a little tit I weaseled my way into it. There's not much to remember from those days except that unless you brought your ship to a dead stop before initiating warp, the momentum would do hilarious things to your course. A velocity of 1m/s could mean going off course by some few hundred thousand kilometers from your intended target. Also, there was no autopilot, and no star map. People *sold* maps, because without those little hand-drawn reference guides you could easily end up in the arse end of nowhere. It was fun.

Closed Beta, then Open Beta rolled through, and the shape of things to come reared its ugly head. By then TAOSP, or ""The Armada of Shin's Pants"" had migrated from Homeworld to the EVE Beta, later becoming the infamous corporation ""Evolution"" post-release and founding Band of Brothers, the eternal Goony foe (who did not exist as an entity for another few years after release). I joined Evolution for a spell, largely by way of having been around for fucking ever even back in 2003, but I was still a little tit so the little tit went the little tit's way. I still got to participate in the first Venal War and the first Curse War, which was cool.

The thing is, at launch there was no cohesion to the politics of EVE. Fountain was largely ruled by disparate, warring pirates and privateers until Evolution moved in, cleaned house and established the Fountain Alliance. In Venal, a similar development occurred when Taggart Transdimensional rolled into town and established a pseudo-democracy in the Venal Alliance. Down south-east, Curse was still struggling with birthing any superpowers, since displaced pirates from the north and the west had largely moved there to do their thing. The Curse Alliance (which I had been a member of prior to joining Evolution) was doing their best, and my corporation (Endless Corp. [TEC]) had a **Whole Battleship** (egads). I still remember the sting of losing my prized Vexor cruiser when M0O (Masters of Ownage) crashed a mining operation there. M0O had previously gained notoriety by completely fucking shutting down the Mara-Passari corridor, which back then was the primary connection between The Citadel and The Forge. CCP actually mobilized an event team masquerading as CONCORD and assaulted the pirates, and had their cheat-y CONCORD battleships equipped with cheat-y modules *whipped* by Amarr cruisers stacking damage mods and projectile turrets. It was hilarious.

But underlying that was the transformation of EVE, previously occupied by disorganized Warlords acting on the strength of their respective corporations, then conquered by stronger entities that coalesced into the first Alliances that would, and could, exert influence across entire regions.

Meanwhile, I left Evolution on less-than-awesome terms, which I'll omit from here as it paints me in quite the bad light and there's enough of that in here already.

Some aimless wandering later, I was contacted by an old beta friend Pallantre about him and his buddy, HellGremlin, setting up a mercenary/murder company called Black Monkey. It was fun shit, right from the start. Someone would identify and infiltrate ""soft"" targets, generally high-sec industrial corps comprised of newbies, and then the rest of us would barrel down in a swarm of Incursus frigates and absolutely ruin them by strength of knowing somewhat what we were doing. After a while of doing this, HellGremlin (now using the character Istvaan Shogaatsu) felt the need to flex his narrative wings, and The Guiding Hand Social Club was created.

We slowly started to make a name for ourselves in high-sec lanes, such as it was, trashing a succession of innocent corporations for our own enrichment and amusement. But more importantly, there was a new purpose to the whole thing, because GHSC was from the get-go a roleplaying corporation. Istvaan was fairly prolific in writing short stories and fleshing out the background and aesthetic of the Club, and some of us others got swept up in it as well, dumping our awful fanfiction onto the forums. At least five official chronicles were penned by GHSC members, as well, including my own ""Stairway to Heaven"".

BodyCount Inc. was starting up at the time (later founding the Mercenary Coalition, or MC) and we enjoyed a mixture of rivalry and professional admiration on both sides. While BDCI was always more of a heavy-hitter, our operatives had long since perfected the art of infiltration and mind games inside target corporations. Hell, some of our escapades were actually *paid* contracts, too, a rarity back in the day. As an amusing aside, Istvaan Shogaatsu had been a member of Something Awful forums, and helped set up the first Goon corporation in EVE, with the secret intent of using them as pawns in whatever the hell we felt like at the time. This was unfortunately spoiled by one of our own letting the whole thing slip in a conversation with one of the members, Istvaan got banned from SA and we ended up killing off like 3 of the first Goonfleet incarnations. GHSC corporate offices still contain Remedial's corpses, somewhere. We used to collect them.

Somewhere between contracts, I also got my start and end in the single most enjoyable adventure I ever had in EVE. To explain; T2 was still a relative novelty, having been introduced with the Castor expansion. Also, 0.0 alliances were entirely based in NPC stations, since player-owned structures had not been introduced at that point (except for Conquerable Stations, which were unreliable at best and a joke at worst). As such, trade was *explicitly* banned in almost every Alliance station, because of the possibility that raiding hostiles might stock up and rearm in their very own strongholds. Needless to say, warfare was 98% camping people in stations. I, however, somehow got the idea of smuggling contraband T2 modules into these stations, and with that in mind managed to acquire a unique ""license"" to travel (but not sell) through Fountain Alliance space from its incumbent president (again, Beta connections). And holy shit it was awesome.

My first run was financed entirely through loans; I borrowed some 150 million ISK from a friend (a large sum back then), loaded as much T2 as I could into a fucking *kestrel frigate*, and set off down the long road from Nonni to YZ-LQL. Depending on the modules, I more than doubled my investment, allowing me to both pay back the loan *and* finance another run. On the way back, I'd carry best-in-slot armor repair modules (T2 armor reps hadn't been introduced yet, or were just awful. I forget which) back to Empire and sell that there. It was like I had stumbled onto my own fucking goldmine and I was giggling the whole time. Of course, I was still at the mercy of pirates, roving warbands and whoever felt like taking potshots at the stupid Kestrel I was flying, and since I was in the habit of investing my entire fortune at any time into any single run, I managed to lose everything like two or three times. It didn't matter; I'd just take another loan, and do it all over again. And then Evolution fucking went to war with FA, and killed my golden goose. The other major alliances were closed to me, and I was less than happy about this development. My smuggling days were over as suddenly as they had begun.

A guy named DigitalCommunist had joined the Guiding Hand Social Club some time previous with a character named Arenis Xemdal. Arenis later ""left"" to join Ubiqua Seraph, founders and leaders of the Aegis Militia, an Amarrian RP alliance. He quickly became their most valued pilot, leading sorties and fleets against their hated Minmatar enemies, whose fleets were coincidentally often led by another GHSC member, Hamish (secretly Tyrrax Thorrk). Some months later, [this whole thing happened](http://eve.klaki.net/heist/). The codeword ""Nicole"" was uttered, Uuve Savisaalo webbed and scrambled the target, and Arenis Xemdal performed the execution in his priceless Imperial Apocalypse while strategically placed operatives simultaneously robbed every corporate outpost they could.

And for us in GHSC, the whole world seemed to fucking explode.

Istvaan seized the moment masterfully, expertly telling a tale of deep corporate intrigue with all due embellishment, in co-operation with DigitalCommunist. Interviews rolled in, from PCGamer to New Scientist to BBC. According to CCP, there was a sudden spike in new subscriptions. More than once I'd stop and ask myself what the fuck was happening, and then re-affirming my vow to never, ever piss off DigitalCommunist. Ever. Seriously.

This was aided by our previous efforts in establishing a backstory, flair and theme for the Guiding Hand, because people ate it up. The idea of a secretive (HAH!) collective of sociopathic manipulators pulling the strings behind the scenes, plotting the rise and fall of Empires, well, it was a lovely fantasy. It was so lovely that many became willing partners in creating and maintaining it, even if it just meant recognizing the chilling reminder that infiltrators were a very real threat to any EVE corporation. Suddenly EVE was both more fantastical and real than anyone had henceforth imagined.

We did some shit after that, but the effort and timespan that went into the Great Heist wasn't matched until later, when Tyrrax asked me if I wanted to join him and ""some newbies"" in a new corporation called Umbra Congregatio [UMCON]. It wasn't much at first; we had joined some deadbeat alliance in the ass-end of Catch called Manticore or something, except Umcon was actually working with another alliance called Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate [IAC] with the intent of removing Manticore and allowing IAC to expand into the area proper. Which we did, and IAC followed.

Now, there's a lot of fucking history here, but I'll try to condense shit;

ISS had a station nearby, the ISS Marginis, the *first* open trade port in EVE, one of the first player stations built in EVE (like, third, or something), funded entirely through an IPO and protected by virtue of most all neighbouring powerhouses owning a share in the whole enterprise such as CA and Lotka Volterra. Now, IAC had its own station at that point, and was close to erecting a new one. In fact, *right after* that second station was erected, MC suddenly appeared and put our first station into lockdown. MC outnumbered us, outgunned us and outplanned us, but thanks to that new station 3 jumps away we had an available rally point, and thanks to a timely intervention from the Goons, we held. Somehow, we fucking held, mostly by crashing the node repeatedly through record fleet turnouts. Them were heady days, our little alliance beset by a faceless puppetmaster with the finances to hire one of the most powerful alliances in the game to wipe us out, and we held.

Problem was that accusations of MC staging their initial assaults from the ISS Marginis quickly turned into a diplomatic dispute between ISS and IAC. IAC allying itself with a group of pirates that liked to raid ISS space didn't help, but those pirates had helped us during the invasion while ISS had seemingly hosted the invading forces.

Coinciding with this, there was an Alliance Tournament. Representing IAC was Tyrrax Thorrk, me, and a few others lovely blokes. Tyrrax fielded his Imperial Apocalypse, of which three remained in total, with me as the pilot. Then it died, on live broadcast. Shortly after, I arrived at the studio as a guest commentator (I will never willingly go on TV again) for later games, and had the privilege of announcing IAC's war declaration on the ISS after receiving a text message from Tyrrax while on air.

The world exploded a second time. Lotka Volterra was mobilized, along with the MC to assist ISS. Goonswarm again came to our aid, and even managed to convince aAa to join us. That was the start of the Great Southern War. It didn't end until the Goons disbanded BoB, and even then, I don't know.

I'm stopping here, because I'm losing consciousness. Good night."
45,2012-01-14 21:56:51,"I appreciate the work this subreddit does to try to improve the political atmosphere in the US. BUT, do you all agree that the ONLY way to change the status quo has nothing to do with a candidate (i.e., Ron Paul, it seems for you all), but a dramatic change in the two party system itself?","Full disclosure: I am still a supporter of Barack Obama, and a big believer in the fact that Obama has the best interest of the country in mind, but I feel his actions have been egregiously influenced by the corrupt system in place around him. I really do believe he is the liberal politician at heart that I and others formerly believed he is, but I feel that he sees that taking a more conservative stance in the current atmosphere, with the current congressional body, to be better in the long run.

My lesson during his presidency is that the current two party system is the destructive influence upon this country. I cannot speak to the efficacy of a parliamentary system, and I would appreciate further education from those of you who live under such a government, but I have come to feel that our governmental system is the establishment that has led this nation along the road to inadequacy and foolishness–to put it in mild terms–that has manifested itself in recent years regardless of the current executive branch leader. 

I firmly believe that Reddit's political influence of late has been wonderful and quite significant given our status as a heterogenous group of (relatively) young individuals, but I find it impossible that we could foster significant change in the United States without directly protesting the unchanging system that, inherently, is leading us along a path that yields no change in how we elect our representatives at a larger scale.

In my view, which I really would love to have argued against here, is that the two party system is the true factor that is destroying this country and, both directly and indirectly, damaging large portions of the world.

EDIT: I started off my text discussion with a defense of my pro-Obama stance. But, despite my defenses of the president below, this is merely my opinion of his presidency, not an advocacy for his reelection. I really value a true discussion of affecting change upon our system, regardless of your belief in Obama, Paul, Romney, Kucinich, whoever. I apologize if my admitted bias has directed the discussion poorly, but that was not my intent.

TL;DR: I'm not advocating Obama, just disclosing my support. I wish to discuss the party system, including campaign finance reform, as it appears now, in a logical and respectful manner, if possible."
46,2012-10-12 14:55:14,"""I'm in HR! Don't you know I can have your job?""","I've been casually reading lately and most of the tales I've come across in my years in Tech Phone support are pretty hilarious (as well as facepalm worthy)  allow me to share my tale  of a mega bitch who, for the first time in my life, made me feel like a real piece of shit.

After some years of unemployment, I got out of finance and changed my career to IT, now working in a fortune 500 company. ( IT seemed like a logical choice since I was the only IT person in my previous job). I've had my fair share of rude, angry and downright awful callers, but this one--well, she took the cake. 

Derpina called and immediately asked for my coworker. He had just gone to lunch, so I explained that and asked if there is anything I could do to help. In her most threatening voice she responds: ""No, you will get Coworker for me so he can do what I need him to do"" At this point I tell her again and she reluctantly allows me to remote into her computer, smugly telling me that she needed a file compressed for sending through e mail. No Problem. I begin the process of compressing the file (a M$FT powerpoint file). She then interrupts me 

**Derpina**: STOP. RIGHT. THERE. 

**Me**: Uh, sure...

**Derpina**: Do you even know what you are doing? I do NOT want you to Compress this file, I need you to Compress it to send through E mail. What is your problem? CAN'T YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS? JUST PUT COWORKER ON THE PHONE. HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS ANYTHING IN YOUR DEPARTMENT!!!

At this point I am on mute and talking with a lead in my dept, telling him that I cannot help this person until she calms down and stops yelling and belittling me. My lead tells me to continue on, I was doign what she asked. I go back to the call and calmly ask what she expects that I do. This comes next: 

**Derpina**: (In a smug, know it all tone) Clearly, you have no idea what you are doing. I am asking you to compress this file--but you are NOT DOING IT RIGHT! you need to get your coworker on the phone because he knows what I want done. I have a 4pm meeting and this needs to go out RIGHT NOW. Now...put your little mouse here (points me to power point) and Compress this file!!!! 

at this point, I'm on mute again, about to lose my temper. I tell my lead I cannot resume this phone call. I can hear her on mute cackling with her friends--she DID NOT put her phone on mute and was unaware the calls are always recorded. I hear her saying this: 

**Derpina**: These IT people are so stupid! Yeah, They can't do a thing. And yeah--I'm a bitch! I treat them like crap because they should have gone to college in the first place. Doesn't this girl know I'm in HR? I could have her JOB! 

I transfer the call over to my lead and say, ""I' going to transfer you to my coworker (i lied) and perhaps he will be able to help you""  

**Derpina**: Well, you've wasted enough of my time! Do us all a favor and learn a thing or two! 

I hit transfer, put myself in break. I've had plenty of rude people. Not one made me feel like I felt after that call. All of my education, (yes, I did go to college for Fine Art) my subsequent experience and everything never prepared me for that. I looked her up--a smug 27 year old Administrative Assistant. Her issue was she wanted the IMAGES IN POWERPOINT compressed. 

I think the worse part was the fact that she never got spoken too or reprimanded about her unprofessional behavior. My boss never spoke to me about it. ( told him in an E mail)  She still occasionally calls and I have her name on a post it. If I ever get her again, She is immediately transferred to my boss. 

TL;DR: Clearly, I need to get out of Phone Support.

Until recently (promotion, woo!), I was a Help Desk worker drone for a small hospital system. We are the the first line of defense for the hundred or so programmer analysts, networking techs, engineers, clinical IT educators, etc who work downstairs from us. We are in a small building behind one of the main hospitals in this system (there are four very large acute hospitals and dozens of smaller off-sites who we do IT support for). If a nurse/doctor/aide/finance analyst/janitor/delivery person/outside vendor or pretty much anyone at one of these sites has a computer issue, we receive the call and try to fix it or pass it along to the proper group for later resolution. Simple fixes such as password resets, local print server power-cycling, patient data resends... those are first call resolution and we have it done in minutes. Difficult issues, ones that require in-depth work, or systems we have no access to get sent off into the ticketing system void.

A few days ago I received a frantic call from a doctor... below is a fairly accurate transcript of the call (I recorded it with my call-taking program as he became belligerent right off the bat and listened to it later with my supervisor). I apologize for the block of text but it's burned into my head so I'll give the entire conversation rather than a summary. Feel free to skip to the bottom for a TL;DR.

Doc: I can't log in. You need to fix it for me.

Me: Okay, sir. What program are we having an issue with?

Doc: I can't view images. It's not letting me log in and I need to log in right now. I have a patient with me, I need to be able to view images.

Me: Images? Okay so are these [Clinical Program 1] documents?

Doc: No. No. It's not that. Xray images. You need to fix it so I can log in.

Me: Okay, so [Imaging Program 1]? Is that the program?

Doc: Yes. And this is ridiculous, I shouldn't have to be calling for this, it's not accepting my password.

Me: Right. Well we can reset it for you and...

Doc: I don't need a reset. You need to fix the program. There's something wrong, it won't accept my password. I've used this one for years.

Me: Well I apologize for any inconvenience but a reset should get you right in.

Doc: Fine but I want someone to look into why it won't take my password.

Me: [Wishing I could tell him it's because he doesn't *know* his password...] Definitely, sir. Let me just get some of your information.

He answers all my requests for his name, ~~username~~, department info, etc.

[Edit: I didn't get his username, sorry. I was just listing things that I usually grab. Anyway, even if I had gotten it, we don't have access or even accounts for that system so I have no idea what the standard format is nor the # of characters...]

Me: Alright well let me send this over to our [Imaging System] Analyst so they can reset that for you.

Doc: What? No, I need you to reset it for me right now.

Me: Right. Well I'm going to give this ticket to the team responsible for that system so that they can...

Doc: No, no no no. I need to log in *right now.* I have a patient.

Me: I understand, sir. So I'll send this over to the analysts and they can reset this for you immediately, it shouldn't take long.

Doc: I don't think you **understand.** I can't wait on this. Why won't you reset it for me now?

Me: Because I can't. I don't have that ability.

Doc: Why? Why can't you just reset it? You reset passwords all the time!

Me: We do but I don't have access for this system.

Doc: What, why?

Me: Because we administrate *hundreds* of programs in IT sir and the Help Desk does not work on them all. [Program] is one of the many which we don't even have a login for. So let me just send this over to the analysts...

Doc: No. That's not what you're going to do. *What you're going to do* is give me the phone number of the person who fixes this, right now, and *I'll* take care of this then.

Me: [Furious at being told that I should disregard multiple policies as well as go directly against our workflow *and* give out internal numbers so that an angry doctor can get priority because he forgot his password, I pause for a few seconds.] So if you'll let me get working on this the analyst can reset that right away.

Doc: [angry laugh] You obviously aren't listening to what I'm saying. I'm going to have to take this somewhere. I'm sure Dr. [Person] (the president of our IT group) would love to hear why you're refusing me service.

Me: [pausing again] I'm going to send this ticket on, would you like me to call the analyst right now? I can put you on hold for thirty seconds while I call them up directly.

Doc: Fine. That will work.

Me: Is that okay?

Doc: Yes.

At this point I am, of course, furious. My text above may not fully encapsulate the level of condescension in his voice when telling me that I didn't understand or while he told me how to do my job. I call out to both of the analysts responsible for the system and leave voicemails on both of their cell phones. I call both of their desk phones, hoping that they won't ignore those as well... and then I receive a call back. Analyst A has called me back, unhappy that I'm calling for a simple password reset. Doctor Anger has been on hold for a few minutes now and I see the light stop blinking as he hangs up the line. Analyst A gives me the doctor's username and a new provisional password; I thank him. Analyst B calls up and I explain that the situation is now fixed. Time to call back Dr. Hissyfit.

Doc: Yes?

Me: It's War_Whale from the Help Desk. I have your password.

Doc: You told me thirty seconds. I was on hold for five minutes.

Me: Yes, sir, I apologize. I had to make four calls and could not reach anyone at first.

Doc: What is it.

Me: Okay so the new password is ""Welcome1."" Capital double-you on that and the numeral one. Try that for me.

Doc: ..... no. [exasperated sigh] It doesn't *work.*

Me: Give it one more try for me.

Doc: But I'm telling you... no. It's **not working.** Did you even reset it?

Me: So we're typing ""Welcome1"" correct? Caps lock is off, number lock is on if you need it...

Doc: This is silly. Yes. Yes, I know all that.

Me: And your username is... ?

Doc: ""flastname."" My first initial and last name. ""flastname""

Me: [stifling a torrent of laughter that wipes out the past 10 minutes of awfulness] No.

Doc: What?

Me: No. It's not that. You have too many letters.

Doc: ...

Me: It's ""flastnam."" Leave off the ""e."" Your username doesn't have the last ""e."" It has *never* had the ""e"" because your last name is fairly long. Usernames cut off after so many characters. [I'll admit, I voiced the next part in my most patronizing, sing-song voice] Can you please enter your proper username, ""flastnam"" and ""Welcome1"" for me?

Doc: ...... thank you. [CLICK]

**TL;DR A doctor asked me to ""fix"" a program because it wasn't taking the password he had been using for years (the program was obviously broken as there was no way he could have forgotten his password). Not having access to his username or password, I offer him a ticket, he freaks out and threatens my job if I don't connect him to an analyst immediately. After eventually contacting the admin for the program and resetting his password it turns out that... well... he didn't need a password reset! Because he forgot his username.**

I haven't gone from so angry to so happy that quickly in my 5 years doing Help Desk work. That poor bastard. Now the guy has been recorded harassing a Help Desk worker over an incredibly simple and fast ticket which 1) didn't warrant the level of service he was asking for and 2) was entirely his fault. Seeing as standard protocol for recorded issues like that is for my manager to call the caller's manager (mainly to head off any complaints that the caller may come up with about us), I think it might be interesting to see what the manager/director thinks about the doctor's threat to call up the President of IT. I don't imagine the manager/director would relish the idea of one of their MDs bothering the Prez because they forgot a username that hadn't changed in years."

56,2012-06-12 10:53:26,"Thanks USDA, I appreciate the useless regulation you dictated and implemented on Friday. Completely screwing our small company over again. ","The USDA is back in another installment of ""fuck over small business.""


My family runs a small business that buys and sells frozen fruit on a large scale. We typically work with US based growers and processors, and are contracted to sell through inventories. Unfortunately, a large percentage of crop in  the eastern half of the country was wiped out by a post bloom freeze, especially cherries. 

About 85% of US tart (typically used in pies) cherries (Montmorency variety) come from Michigan and the crop was all but wiped out. Unfortunately we still have customers that need cherries, so like any good businessmen we began buying cherries from Poland, importing them through the correct licensed channels. 

On Friday (6/8) the USDA decided that not only the trader, that will conduct the import and deliver the fruit must be certified and holding the permit, but also the buyer (me). 

ME: No big deal, how long do we have to get certified? 
USDA: uh, right now. 

In fact any loads we have in transit, will be held at a dock in NY until we are certified at MY COST! 

There was no press release, now announcement, nothing.

ME: Ok well lets start digging in and find out what it will take. 

... I get to spend hours online making a profile and completing ""level one certification"" after doing that I get to spend more time ""completing level 2 certification"" 

Then finally, after wading through waist high bullshit documentation that includes everything from Federal tax ID information and my goddamn dental records.... I get the privilege of having to drive to my nearest ""local"" USDA office with some Federal form of ID and present it to them.

No big deal I guess... how close is my local USDA office? 

....2 hours away... 

Yay, now I'm level 2 certified after 4 hours of driving.... now I get to buy a permit. 

Good fucking god.... just another bullshit government entity making it impossible for people to do business. We've only been importing fruit for 30 years with no issue. 

I guess I'm just venting, I'm sick of the USDA pushing little guys out of business to give monopolies to huge companies. You should see the completely useless pile of documentation that's needed to sell 1 lb fruit in the country.... The small companies just can't afford all the inspections and documentation. It is absolutely killing smaller guys and drastically driving up the prices for everyone. 

Edit:I found out that this is the APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) department within the USDA apparently I explained it wrong. The traders we use to import fruit and all Canadian traders. They all speak many languages and it's a pretty specialized job. What the APHIS people technically did is strip all Non-US citizens of their importing powers... again... no notice, no press release, just dictating by decree. 

The effect:

The foreign packers (processors) won't be able to invoice the Canadian traders directly who actually have the capital to finance these loads. They will have to invoice my small company for millions...great, that will be nice on our books...couple million in accounts payable, should help me sleep no problem. Plus we have no relationship with these people, no prior credit history with them. Are they just going to extend us millions in credit with no relationship... fuck no. 

Another example of the USDA completely clueless about the complexities of a supply chain. It's like Baby Huey running around a china shop.

*TL;DR* 

Government doesn't understand how delicate the balance is in business, needlessly throwing useless, expensive, time consuming paperwork in the laps pf people who can't afford to comply or people who don't have the time to keep up. They do this with no forethought  or announcement and will put companies out of business on a whim. 



**Edit 2**

Here's an update:

After an hour on the phone with the USDA APHIS department this is what I found out. (The guy was overly patient with me, even though I was taking it out on him...like he wrote the law.... he deserves a medal) 

This law has been on the books since 2009, but US Customs has been not enforcing it. So the USDA apparently can't make Customs enforce the laws, they just write them (unelected assholes write them). So by stripping the non-US citizen permits from Canadian traders they are simply reassigning the risk and penalty to me the small business owner. (me) **While huge companies can afford the risk, we used to outsource it to larger companies (Canadian traders), who would charge us small amount to do so.** 

I also found out that I am liable if there is a mistake. Lets say my permits cover me on Rhubarb from Poland but not Cherries, and I knowingly import cherries, I go to federal prison. Lets say there is a ""pest"" issue on one berry out of 52,000 lbs, (container size) then the load is terminated and I'm out the money. 

I specifically asked him how removing permits from non-US citizens stops pests from entering the country, he could not give me a reason. He did however tell me ""its for your own good,"" my head nearly exploded. 

Long story short... I am now able to get permits for specific fruits, from specific countries that must go to specific ports. We just incurred way more risk for the same rewards. Unfortunately, the loads of cherries that I currently have booked (2) will have to stay at port until until my permits are processed... which only takes a whopping 30 days. I get charged all the costs for having them sit there, which may bring the cost of ownership over the market value. 

TL;DR AGAIN

Apparently it's just that US customs decided to start enforcing a random rule that they have been not enforcing for 3 years.

57,2012-12-18 10:23:57,"I [40F] am pregnant after unsuccessful attempts and miscarriages. My current fiance [30M] isn't supportive, and it is breaking my heart. ","Me: 39F
Him: 30M 
Length of relationship: 2 years

For years, I struggled with fertility. I have had countless chemical pregnancies, 5 miscarriages, 1 late miscarriage, and 1 extremely early birth where my son passed away just hours after being born. It was heart wrenching. I was married ( to someone else) at the time and the struggle this created led to our divorce. 

We tried IVF and even considered adoption. All to no success. The adoption thing could have happened, but my husband and I at the time decided to keep trying. 

The death of our baby really shock both of us. I still can't look at a photo of him. It just hurts too much. 

Then my husband got really depressed about it all, and this led to eventual suicide. I blamed myself for a long time. It took me almost 5 years to start dating again. By then I was quickly approaching 40 and ,in what my doctors would tell me, going through a possible early menopause ( hot flashes, hormonal changes). I assumed that my time was up. I wasn't meant to have kids.    

I started to turn my life around and started to date a bit. I even moved to a new state for a new lease on life. I started dating a younger man. 

We used protection, and nothing happened for two years. Then it did. And now I am pregnant. And I am 40 and this might be my last shot at this. 

I found out 5 weeks ago and I kept it a secret from him because I had been in that situation so many times that I couldn't take having to tell someone I had a miscarriage again. I figure it is probably going to happen anyway. 12 weeks rolls around and I see my doctor. I am still pregnant. The traditional danger zone is finished so I decide it is time to tell the fiance. 

He was livid, and frustrated and a ton of other emotions that are completely normal for someone in the situation. He tells me that he doesn't ever want kids and that is why he was with someone like me. 

I understand where he is coming and I consider the abortion just like he asks me to. For three days that is all I think about. We discuss it at length. I even talk to a therapist about it. 

Then one day I am sitting in the park by the river and I see these kids on there bikes and all I can think about it that I want a chance. I want a chance to be a parent, and this looks like it might be my one and only. I am not even sure if I can carry a child to term, but what if this is the one that survives? 

He knows about my past fertility issues and all the problems I had. He even knows about the baby that died. He knows I tried so hard for so long. "" Why do you want to put yourself through that again?"" He says. "" Why are you doing this to our relationship?"", he adds. Like I am the only one that did this.   

I tell him I can't do it. He tells me to choose between him or the kid. I refuse and he leaves. 

I am thinking that I can do this by myself. I have a great job, a house, a savings, a wonderful support system, a 401K, health insurance. I have enough money to raise this kid. It won't be easy, but I can do this. I am ready. My parents have been waiting ages for a grandchild ( I am an only child) are ridiculously happy about this. They throw all of their support behind me and tell me that I don't need anyone else. They say I can do. 

I know I could give this baby a wonderful home. I would love him/her like no one has ever loved a child ever. They would be the most wanted baby in the entire world.

He is refusing to tell him parents or family (even though I know they would be thrilled because they have talked about us having kids with hopeful eyes in the future). He says that he will move to another country just to get away from me, and he feels like I betrayed him.

I understand where he is coming from, but come on. I told him I would never force him to be in the kids life. I would never want that for either of them. I could love them enough for both of us. He says that isn't enough and he would hate me forever if the child was born. He only calls me to discuss the abortion and how much time I have left to get one in our state ( I am 15 weeks now)   

I don't want to hurt the man I love but I can't do this to myself. I can't get an abortion when I know this is my only shot. I just can't. 

Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? Has anyone been in this position?

Notes: I know the risk for me. Although the finance has never discussed it or brought it up. I talked to my doctor. He says the risks are there, especially with my history, but that stranger things have happened. He says he supports my decision and that he would do whatever he could to make sure the pregnancy is successful. He even gave me some information about the risks and facts about my situation. 

Also, I know that in a perfect world he would have a say. I understand, but look at my past. All the hell I went through. I owe it to me to try once more. 

And I understand by doing so that I am walking away from my relationship. 

**tl;dr: Had a bad history with pregnancies and not being able to carry. Got pregnant. Now fiance is unsupportive.  I can support the baby only. I know this will end our relationship. How do I deal emotionally?**

To recap: Questions: 

How do I deal emotionally with a break up during pregnancy?
Is there anything I can say to him to make this easier for him? 
Has anyone been in this position?
Any advice from someone is an older single mother?


Any advice would be appreciated. Kind of new to reddit so please forgive any breaking the rules. They aren't intentional. Thank you!

Edit: Found out I was pregnant 5 weeks ago, not 13 ( mistyped that). Waited until 12 weeks to tell fiance. I am now 15 weeks. 

Edit 2: For the last time, I am not asking anyone here if they thought I made the right decision. I am asking for advice on how to handle the break up. Please read the questions. I have made the choice. It is done. Enough. I am not getting an abortion.   

Edit 3: everyone seems to be adding a lot or filling in a lot of details that actually never happened to justify their stance. Stop that. You weren't there. 

To clarify: he was present at all my bc shots. He saw me get the shots every time I went. I didn't not fail in taking my precautions. I did not get pregnant on purpose.

He knew I wanted kids from the start. I told him, repeatedly.

I never once said he had do anything for me and I have not/ will not force his hand. 

He keeps contacting me to push abortion at me. I never call him.

I waited 5 weeks to tell him because I assumed I would miscarry yet again and wanted to save myself a little grief. Should I have told him sooner? Yes. Why did I wait? See my pregnancy history. 

The kid is here. Well, the pregnancy is here. I am not having an abortion. I already made that decision. He doesn't have to be in his life if he doesn't want to but I don't have to sit around and feel bad about my decision just because he wasn't ready.

Haven't I been through enough already?

I came here for help with a breaking up issue, and I got attacked for my decision and for what people falsely believed I was doing despite my repeatedly assurance that I wasn't forcing him to do anything.

For the people that offered real advice, thank you.  For everyone else, read my post again and really think about shit before you say it. Fuck. I have fucking feelings too. You
Bastards. Thanks a lot. "

59,2012-09-02 01:15:21,"It's raining RAM, hallelujah!","This is long, but it's how I became a real BOFH.

Many moons ago, when I was a literal PFY (damn acne), my office decided to expand and bought a building across the street. As a wee PFY stuck doing a lot of desktop crap, I volunteered to help set up the new server room in the hopes of getting a better job (it worked). This meant I was making multiple trips across a four lane, two-way road, with a dolly.

At the time, there was no stop light or sign in the middle, where we were, but there were ones on either end of the block. Officially we were supposed to walk to the end of the block, wait for the light to change, cross, and walk back. Bitch, please! 

I'm trundling back and forth with server parts, monitors, whatever, and delivering them to the brand new control center. Suddenly I see one of the windows BOFHs dead ass *sprinting* towards me, his arms filled with backup tapes. He's a big guy, used to be a linebacker in college, but well gone to seed now. This man does not run. Ron (not his real name) saunters at best.

""Ron, man, what's up?"" I ask.

""BIP! Ditch that load and bring the dolly back!""

I don't question him, but it's here I notice something off... Ron's wet. ""Should I get the bigger one?"" I ask carefully. I was avoiding it because I was a 120lb kid at the time (god I miss that) and I couldn't muscle it loaded.

""Yes! Good thinking!"" and he's gone.

I go bad to switch carts and my shoes (dress shoes to sneakers, finance company). This was very smart, as when I get back to the new building, there is a funny feel to the lobby. The guard waves me through and I get up to the server room... And it's wet.

All over.

Its raining in the damn server room and the real windows PFYs are just standing around. The servers were off the floor, but I quickly noticed they we still on, and shout, ""I'm shutting them down!""

To this day I have no idea why the other guys stood there with their thumbs up their butts, but I turned the servers off and started hauling them out of the room. Even though I was the juniorest PFY, and not even a server admin at the time, I started bossing them around. ""Herp, go find Manager and tell her what happened! Derp, take apart the racks, we can put them up back in the old building!""

By the time BOFH comes back, he is relieved to see people are doing things, and he and I start triage. This is dead, this is okay, etc etc. Since I'm half his size, Ron takes the servers back and forth across the street, leaving me to get maintenance to turn off the water (they didn't want to because they could only do it for the whole building). We turn off the water, and the manager finally shows up. She is thrilled we've got it under control, takes the status, and tells me what happened.

Upstairs is the cafeteria. And by upstairs, what I mean is directly above this room. And the morons cut the water line. She goes on to say that my call to shut the water off is probably going to save us millions, shook my hand, and then said she was drafting me. She said she'd email everyone what was up, and tell my boss. Oh and I'll get double OT.

Once the water was off, we were able to clean up and save most of the servers. Seven PM rolls around and we're still slogging away, when one of the Suits shows up.

""Why is the server still off?""

I'm seriously wet, trying to decide if this joker is screwing with me. ""Which server?"" I ask, stalling for time.

""The trade server!""

We labeled them all on the outside, so I take a quick look and see the trade server was, naturally, the one under the flow. ""I'm sorry, that one was ruined. But Ron has his PFY restoring it from backup across the street. Should be done tonight, and we can process the trades."" I gesture at the server.

Now we have a backup server that was actually doing the work, albeit slowly, and we didn't lose any trades. But the end of day processing, where we do 'night' work was dead.

""It's unplugged!"" he shouts and starts to push past me.

I'm five foot nothing, a hundred twenty nothing. I jump up and hold up my hands, causing him to smack into them. ""Sir! The sever is wet! You will electrocute yourself!"" The power was also off, but let's not get into that. I forgot at the time.

""Shut up, girl! You don't know how important this is!""

Ron had sort of ignore this up until now, but I clearly heard him say WTF and he came over as I was explaining I did understand, but the server was not getting plugged back in.

Suit swatted my hands, and Ron, all 6'8"" and over 200lbs of him, steps up. ""Touch her, or call her girl, and I'll let you plug the server in,"" he snaps.

The absurdity of that sentence gave Suit pause, and Ron lays it the saga. ""Well why didn't she say that the server got wet?"" complains the suit. We both stared at him as he ranted that I didn't tell him the servers were went, and he storms off.

We finally get it all cleaned up, I get home around one, with a 'take the day off' credit, so it's a while before I think to check my work email. When I do, I have a note to call HR. Suit complained. I forward the message to Ron and his manager, as well as mine, and say I want Ron there in the meeting. When I roll in to work, it's all over. Ron told his manager what happened, she went to HR, and Suit sent me a formal apology. Ron's manager got me transferred to her team and hired me as a real BOFH not six months later.

tl;dr Money still works when it's wet! So should electronics!

62,2012-11-02 14:04:21,Discounted software Bazaar,"Just happened momments ago.

Today I began some research for my company to purchase Popular Finance Program (PFP) and we need 2 versions, PFP US and PFP Canadian.  I called the US vendor, he was more than helpful as although he couldn't sell me the Canadian version, he emailed me a quote and gave me the number to the Canadian office as well.

So I gave them a ring.  First thing I noticed was they had some nice soothing classical on hold music, which was refreshing for once.  But my horrors began once the salesman answered my call.  

Salesman: ""Hello can I get your company profile or phone number?""

""I dont have a profile, here is my number XXXXXXXX""

Salesman: ""Ok I don't see your profile in our system""

""Right I need to purchase a new license of PFP Canadian Premiere version.""

""Salesman: Oh ok can I get your company address?""

""Look I'm just looking for a price quo""

Salesman: ""NO I need to fill out your profile!  What is your address?""

Gives address

Salesman: ""Ok now what is your CC info?""

""Um what? you are asking for my CC info?  I don't even know how much it costs?  How much is the software?""

Salesman: ""$500""

""...that doesn't seem right, the US version is $319""

Salesman: ""Oh Ok I give discount, $400""

At this point I'm feeling like I'm in some crazy underground Bazaar where people haggle for prices of software.
""Look can I just get you to email me this quote on the software so I can review it with the company?""

Salesman: ""No sir I can not do that, I can't send emails outside of this building.""

""Yeah, this doesn't seem right.  I think I'm going to go.""

Later I was talking to another employee in my company and she tells me she called the same number earlier today and talked to a guy who was incoherent, sounded drunk and like he was outside smoking a cig.  Luckily I went back to the US salesmen guy, told him this story and he got me a website link to the software without having to talk to their canadian office.  He couldn't believe it.

tl;dr: Bazaar, Banshees, Babylon 5"

Dear Albino Walrus,

Thank you for contacting me about the internet streaming of copyrighted material. I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.

On May 12, 2011, Senator Leahy (D-VT) introduced S. 968, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act. While I am supportive of the goals of the bill, I am deeply concerned that the definitions and the means by which the legislation seeks to accomplish these goals will have unintended consequences and hurt innovation, job creation, and threaten online speech and security. On November 17, 2011, I signed a letter along with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) objecting to the bill as it is currently written.

On December 17, 2011, Senator Wyden introduced the ""Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade"" (OPEN) Act (S. 2029), of which I am an original co-sponsor. The bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee, where it is currently awaiting further review. The OPEN Act is a more effective approach to stopping foreign web sites that are found to be primarily and willfully used to infringe intellectual property rights. The OPEN Act builds on the existing legal framework used by the International Trade Commission for addressing unfair acts in the importation of articles into the United States, or in their sale for importation, or sale within the United States after importation.

Our trade laws have yet to catch up to deal with the global digital economy. The OPEN Act recognizes that the Internet has created new opportunities for foreign products to reach the U.S. market and that there is little difference between downloading a pirated movie from a foreign website and importing a counterfeit movie DVD from a foreign company. For those foreign web sites that are determined after an investigation to be primarily and willfully infringing, the International Trade Commission will issue a ""Cease and Desist"" order. The ""Cease and Desist"" order may also be served on financial intermediaries that provide services to that foreign web site, compelling financial payment processors and online advertising providers to cease doing business with the foreign site in question. This would cut off financial incentives for this illegal activity and deter these unfair imports from reaching the U.S. market.

The OPEN Act addresses the same challenges as the PROTECT IP Act, while protecting freedom of speech, innovation, and security on the Internet. The challenge of rogue web sites is one that many nation's face. The United State has always been seen as a leader on Internet issues. Laws we establish in the United States regarding the Internet are likely to be used as models around the world. And because the Internet is global in nature, it is important that we carefully consider how the laws and policies we adopt in this area may be received and translated by other countries.

Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts on this matter. You may also be interested in signing up for periodic updates for Washington State residents. If you are interested in subscribing to this update, please visit my website at http://cantwell.senate.gov. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of further assistance.

Sincerely, Maria Cantwell United States Senator

TL;DR My senator does not support SOPA or PIPA, she co-sponsored OPEN which would effectively shut down a lot of foreign sites, like Pirate Bay.  Congress is not relenting, they will continue to push Internet regulation under different bills until they succeed. OPEN does exactly the opposite of its name, it censors the net!

","Sitting in Starbuck's studying for Calc II when randomly an older man comes up and says something about Calculus. Although I'm kinda weirded out because he's a random old guy, we strike up a good 5-10 minute convo. I notice this cute 'older' woman (late 20s-early 30s range - I'm almost 20) in the corner of the store listening in on our conversation and smiling a little. 

The guy leaves and I go back to studying for another half hour or so. Eventually I look up and the older woman and I make eye contact. I smiled, and that was when I decided DGAF about her age or what comes of this conversation - I'm gonna approach. I used the excuse of getting up to grab some napkins to walk by her, and at that moment I notice a guy walking his two german shepherd puppies outside. I use the dogs to open and we eventually get on the topic of Finance - she's trying to get some professional finance licenses. That's great, because I'm a finance major. Body language turns to face each other. There's the hook, BAM. 

The conversation continues, turns deep, and she eventually asks me if I'm interested in employment in Finance. By the end of the conversation I've given her my info, she's given me her card, and I'm being invited to a company event where I'll get to meet her superiors and possibly land a paid summer internship.

73,2012-01-30 12:29:13,My car buying experience. ,"Bought a used car over the weekend, though you guys might benefit from my preparation and buying experience. I am not at all experienced with buying cars (1 car 12 years ago), and I don't enjoy negotiation. For what it's worth, I have excellent credit. So some of my experience may have been dictated by that YMMV. 


I started with cars.com and autotrader.com. After I found the car with the options I wanted, I jumped on the dealer's website and verified it was still in stock and the sticker price. One important note is dealers don't put all their stock on those sites.


I hit kbb.com, edmunds.com and NADA.com to get an independent price estimate for that particular car. I also checked the free carfax to make sure everything was in order there. 


Went to lendingtree.com and filled out a used car loan application. I really did it just to see what kind of rates I might get..I didn't expect to USE any of the financing, but I ended up being approved for an auto loan by Capitol One with a great rate. I should have called my local bank to see what kind of rate I'd get with them, but I didn't feel like spending the time on the phone. 


I made up a little card in Excel that showed the sale price of the car, my down payment, and what my monthly payment would be given various sale prices/down payments. I brought it with me to the dealership and kept it handy. You ALWAYS want to negotiate based on final price. However, you do want to have an idea what your payment will be while you're negotiating. The card helped me to stay aware when numbers were flying around.


ALL the buying guides I read said you should always be prepared to walk away from the deal. So, at the dealership I  wanted to see if the salesman would chase me if I walked. I made an pretty low offer ($2,300 under sticker), and only came up $300 after their counter, and wouldn't budge after that. That was WAY under what I was prepared to spend, but they accepted $2,000 off sticker. I even said I wouldn't pay the $129 document fee and they knocked THAT off. Being a dick paid off to the tune of $1,400!


I made it clear when I started talking to the salesman that I had already secured financing. However, I said I'd be happy to finance with them if they could get me a better interest rate. When we eventually sat down to sign papers they told me they just matched my rate from Capitol One. That's the one thing I wish I had protested. I couldn't muster enough douchebag to make an issue of it though. 


I was pretty anxious about the buying experience, but I stuck to my guns and it paid off. The only mistakes I can see are not spending more time on the phone checking out financing and not dickering over the interest rate. Those shouldn't bite me too hard since I'll likely pay the loan off early. 


**TLDR acting like a stubborn dickhead at the car dealer CAN save you money**


**Edit**: Thanks to everyone sharing advice and contributing positively to discussion! Already learned some stuff for next time!

81,2012-10-23 22:13:20,Auditors gave me a promotion,"Tale #2 from my former place of employment first one [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/11fdjm/i_am_right_clicking/)

quick background:  my former boss and I had strange relationship, he looked at me as more of a social friend but didnt care for my personal growth.  The owner of the company and I had a really good relationship both professional and personal.

Being a finance company we had to go through various audits on a yearly basis.  One of them required quite a bit of information about our systems, network and security.  

So it was their yearly visit my boss (Director of Technology) was sitting down with them and the owner of the company going over the different questions they had.   They were meeting in the office I shared with my boss (yes I was a 1 man IT team but we only had about 50-60 users)  so I was just sort of there by default at my small desk.

My boss who I always felt more or less lucked into the job with some old certifications never really kept up with current technology and really left me to do a lot of that while he messed around (a story for another day) 

So the auditors start asking what sort of network structure we have, the database we store our data in, who has access, who are domain admins etc and my boss is at a complete loss - he knows none of this of the top of his head and starts looking really bad.  He tells them that he can get that info to them and they said they need it now.

So the owner looks at me and says the_yoyo you know any of these answers 

so at the risk of making my boss look like a fool I said -- yeah i may know a few

so the auditors start asking me and I answer all the questions they had with the exception of the two regarding quickbooks (which I had no access to) 

so the auditors look to my boss and owner and say ""i am not sure how much the_yoyo gets paid here but he deserves a raise, out of all the departments we had to question for your audit certification he was the most detailed in his answers and prepared - which is saying something since he didnt get a chance to prepare""

my boss is completely red in his face -- i had asked for a raise several times but he always shot me down saying the company had no many *(partially true the company wasnt doing well, but turns out he never bothered asking the owner - former boss was a complete asshole)*

the owner says back - you know he does and its long overdue I havent really received any raise paperwork from his boss in sometime but I think he does deserve one too

I said thanks to both of them and didnt give it much thought since I believed all that raise talk from the owner was just to appease the auditors, but the next day he called me in his office.

owner: the_yoyo it seems you havent had a raise in nearly the last two years, i am surprised you haven't asked for one. son you need to be able to assess your self worth -- clearly the auditors yesterday felt you deserved one so I want to give you one since its been so long and you certainly have earned it but i guess my question is why

me: but i have requested for raises, actually several times to my boss over the last 2 years but he said that you turned them down since the company wasn't making any more

owner: WHAT? i've never received anything of the sort -- I am going to have a talk with him but in the meantime whether he likes it or now I am going to bump you up to a level you deserve.  Those auditors asked me what your position was and they were surprised that your title was help desk.  They suggested that you are made a jr systems administrator.  So I already told HR to make that change and I am going to give you a 18% raise as well.  Sorry I am going to talk to your boss about why I hadn't received any raise requests for you before, I am sorry I get so busy with work its hard for me to keep track. 

I thanked him profusely and emailed the auditors and also thanked them for the promotion they gave me.

My boss though?  He wasnt too happy about it -- he said that I shouldn't have gone over his head to the owner about a raise (which I didn't) and that it was my fault that I didn't tell him the answers to the questions before hand and that I made him look bad.

I told him that I had no idea what the questions were and if I made him look bad its not because I wanted him to but because he didn't even know his own network or system that he is supposed to manage.

I left less than a year later thank god"

My answer remains:

""[System 1] removed that feature two versions ago, so when we upgraded to be compliant with the new hardware, we weren't able to turn that on. [System 2] *can* use it, but no one wanted to spend the money. Also we don't change the [system dist account] password because S2 is so old, it would mean rewriting code we've been using since the 80s, and no one wanted to pay for that either.""

Every week, like clockwork, I get that email, to the point that I set up an auto-reply for my ex-boss with that in it. Thursday rolls around and he emails, gets the auto reply, and calls me back. We were friends outside of work, I used to borrow his kids for adventures, and when his evil ex-wife screwed him over, I was moral support.

Everything was documented, too. I was a fucking dream to these people.

""What about Derp? He's my friend and their manager-""

""Oh I'm very good--"" And then it hit me. When he said 'con' it rang a bell. ""Is Mr. Suit still there?""

""Let me check... Yes, looks like he's working on windows security auditing.""

""Tell HR you need to look at his record in regards to me. I'll email you my docs.""

We hang up, I send him the docs, and a list of witnesses. Friday he emailed that all was fine, don't worry about a thing. Saturday, one of my HR friends calls and says its too bad I'm out of state, as they're having a party for Mr. Suit's early retirement -- and _he's_ not invited.

86,2012-04-22 09:27:25,Pledge to finance Firefly Season 2 if you win the lottery.,"I was just thinking to myself that there hundreds of thousands of browncoats out there, many of whom play the lottery on a regular basis. After seeing how a bunch of people just won hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S lottery recently it got met thinking.

As fans we should pledge that if any one of us wins a suffecient amount of money we should buy the rights off Fox or finance more Firefly through Fox. Perhaps start with a 2-3 part miniseries to test the waters to show it could be profitable and also that way it wouldnt interfere with the schedules of Firefly actors currently working on other TV series. As the DVD sales have shown your investment would pay off eventually, especially if you just started with a mini-series to test the water.

A massive pipe dream on my part but its mathematically possible that one of us might get lucky enough to make this happen. Plus I just watched ""Objects in Space"" and its downright depressing that other than Serenity there is no more Firefly, felt like I had to do something.

Anyways, if I somehow get enough money I pledge to use that money to finance more Firefly :)

EDIT: Nathan Fillion is with us on the idea he said the following in an interview last year ""If Castle had its series finale tomorrow and Fox said to you and Joss: “We screwed up, let’s try doing Firefly again.” Would you do it?
Yes. Yes. I would examine very closely Fox’s reasoning — I’m a little gun-shy. If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing I would do is buy the rights to Firefly, make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet.""

88,2012-10-23 19:30:27,ATOD Returns in November!,"As some people may be aware, atoD was a tournament held back in April showcasing teams' abilities to sabotage each other's lineups.  The idea is simple: get teams to draft for each other.

Some of the drawbacks of the first tournament were that it was a little last-minute, and teams didn't take it very seriously (rightly so, it was just a fun showmatch with no prize).  Also, the game would have to be remade as allpick after the draft each time so that teams could pick what their opponents drafted for them.

ATOD 2 will address most or all of these problems!

---

*  8 Invited teams to compete (up from 4)
*  Fully supported reverse-CM mode in the Dota 2 client (thank you Valve!)
*  DotaTV support (thank you Valve!)
* Prizepool

---

A final date hasn't been set yet, as I am just confirming with some of the teams involved.

As for the new things, they involve you, the viewer.  The prizepool will consist of two separate funds.  I will be funding $400 (USD) out of pocket to support this event to cover the first fund.  Additionally, 50% of all DotaTV income will go directly into the prizepool.  So the prizepool will be at the very least $400 and can be as big as the community makes it (no final price on DotaTV tickets yet, but it'll probably be $1.49 (USD) or less).

Lastly, the distribution.  Not only will the community support be generating the prize, it will also be determining where it goes.  The breakdown of payment will be as follows:

* 1st Place: 60%
* 2nd Place: 20%
* 3rd Place: 10%
* Fan Favourite: 10%

The fan favourite will be voted and decided on by the viewers.  I'll be making a poll for the fans to decide who gave them the most exciting tournament experience.

Lastly, I'll be making all of this information public when I can.  Not only should this be a good experience for all the viewers, it should also be a good learning opportunity for other Dota Tournaments and exactly how they want to finance their prizepool.

89,2012-12-20 11:30:48,Firearm Industry SITREP 12/20/12 (alternatively: YOU STUPID IDIOTIC MOTHERFUCKERS),"5 days before Christmas and I've got a 99 problems, and accessibility to product is pretty much all of them.

Lets review. 

[I discuss what happens during an Obama second term/Christmas ITT](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/121zg3/fc_protip_of_the_day_102512_how_to_handle_q4/)

[I discuss what happened to the wholesale channel three days after the election ITT.](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/12t7rz/firearm_industry_sitrep_11712/)

Here's the play by play.

Post election, demand was high. But it was NOT and I repeat NOT a 2008. I had some high net worth individuals shake their head at paying any type of premium for a black rifle. I had some that gladly paid my price. Product became hard to come by and a demand premium went into effect. Laypeople got PISSED that dealers raised prices overnight because OH HEY THATS PRICE GOUGING YOU ARE NO WORSE THAN THE GUY WHO SELLS BREAD FOR $9 AFTER KATRINA. 

No asshole, I'm raising prices on a luxury good because demand is up, supply is down and I got the supply and you don't. If you don't like it, you should have done all your AR buying in JULY.

6920's were consistently $12-1300 without blinking in this environment. I use the 6920 as it is a known value in the gun world and a highly commoditized item we all can understand. Some people bought, some people did not.  

After the election, things cooled down. Some guns started trickling back into stock and availability was still limited but if you wanted to put AR style guns on the shelf - you could. You just were not given any choice on selection.

Things went back to ""normal"" a few weeks after election day. You could NOT get ammo or any hard to find stuff but if you wanted mags or other small things like Glock 17's? No problem. Wholesalers had plenty. 

**Friday, December 14.** 

Business as usual at FC HQ. ATF did an audit earlier this month so as they were combing through books I was shutdown. During this time, I took the time to talk to vendors and I ordered every Colt 6920 I could get my hands on as some product was being made available. Vendors were letting 2-4 guns out the door every day to each account just to keep larger accounts from taking all the supply and nobody else gets to play. Which, I can understand and I can respect that. It levels the playing field. I see a news blurb about the shooting.

The phone starts ringing. I start knocking down 6920's at $1050 - which is higher than pre election but lower than today's prices and I sell a few. 

I don't think anything of it, it's just a speedbump. 

**Saturday, December 15.**

I'm at a gun show and I bring 4 rifles to the show, which is 4 rifles than I normally bring. I see no panic buying whatsoever. One person actually needles me and asks me to sell him a gun at a price that involves me paying him $20 to take it off my table. He says he just wants the best deal possible and goes away to buy it at another dealer. 

**Sunday, December 16.**

I see emails about Feinstein flapping her gums and I got an email from one of my sales reps. Saturday night, dealers ordered every single Daniel Defense, Colt, Bushmaster, S&amp;W rifle in their warehouse. Every black rifle they had in stock - GONE. Overnight. Every single PMAG in the building? Gone. Overnight. He wants to know if I know anything. I say no and I wander around at the show. No panic buying, no changes in prices. All my stuff is priced reasonably and I'm wondering what will happen. I leave prices the same. Show closes, I see one or two black rifle sales but nothing worth noting. Seems like business as usual.

**Monday, December 17.**

This is when the wheels came off the wagon. For 12 hours straight my phone rang off the hook. 

My entire day consisted of the following:

""Hi, I see you are a dealer for.....""

""Yes I am and no I don't have what you are looking for.""

""You don't even know what I want yet, how can you know?""

""Stripped lower or complete rifle?""

""....yes.""

""Don't have any.""

12 hours of that. Oh, and combined with emails. Everyone is wanting RRA rifles right now. In fact, someone just called me for an RRA rifle as I typed that out. 

A high net worth individual called freaking out. I tried to talk him out of a panic buy. Sold 2 6920's to him at $1300 each. He didn't even blink. I start wondering what the hell is going on. Started calling vendors.

One vendor's dealer portal is shutdown for maintenence. Could be DDOS attack or could be so many dealers are ordering product the system went down. 

Other vendors I can't even get on the phone. I'm confused.

**Tuesday, December 18**

Phone rings off the hook all morning. I cannot get any paperwork done. I don't take any incoming calls after lunch because I have to concentrate on higher priority things. Talking with vendors, a lot of items are now allocated. Glock 19's are even tough to come by. There isn't a PMAG in the country that can be bought wholesale. Discounting has been eliminated. One of my reps talks about the potential for even further tightening of inventory, as in all accounts at X wholesaler will be getting no more than a certain integer of product. 

This scares me. 

If accessibility to product is further restricted, not just on black rifles - anything firearm related is going to go up in price. For every profit center I lose, I have to make up elsewhere. 

**Wednesday, December 19**

More of the same. I write $13,000 in sales over the phone. All day long people are chasing product that I couldn't get a month ago. 

In conclusion:

The panic buying started on Monday. There was no signs leading up to it. 

Attitudes are shifting. More dealers are being accused of price gouging. I'll share the instances of two people that I pissed off bigtime this week. 

**ANGRY MAN #1**

I had about 20 mags come in about a week before the shooting so that day I earmarked 10 of them to be sold cheap since I got them at promo price from my vendor (whoo hoo, $1 over cost) and made ads for them. Nobody bought. Monday, I sold all the units set aside for that price (10) and I had people bitching at me. Actual conversation with someone who emailed me after I sold all of them at my super low price.

&gt;""Since I placed this order with you before the demand incident I would expect you to honor your price quote to me of $8 per mag shipping included. At this price you are still making a good profit. Had you placed an order with me I would have honored my quote no matter what happened. Please advise if we can work things out. Thanks, Bob""

Note: I'm actually not making a good profit but I told him I sold them all. 

""I had a delivery of 20 of them come in, I set aside half of them at the promo price and I sold them all. If I could restock the product, I would gladly honor the price.""

&gt;""Sir, what does your Email mean? Are you unable to order more? As I said I did place the order while you were advertising the price. Being so said what price will you honor to me  now? Would you sell me two at your old advertised price if not the 4 that I wanted. Please advise. Thanks, Bob""

""You may have emailed me an order and before I got it, I already sold all the promo mags at that price. I will not honor my old price. Sorry. ""

&gt;Well FC I will find someone who would honor their prices. You are a deadbeat and I will post that on gunboards.

Editors note: I love internet tough guys. They are hysterical. 

I try to respond professionally. 

""I am not a deadbeat. Product is very hard to find and I sold all the product I earmarked for the promo. Just because the ad was up with that price did in no way indicate I still had stock available. "" 

&gt;If   you were an honorable man you would have accepted my order. But because of the”shooting” decided you could make more money by raising prices due to the unexpected demand. Shame  on you for taking advantage of a sad situation ! As  said I will post this on all boards. You have NO HONOR! YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN THE KATRINA VICTIMS THAT WERE OVERCHARGED BECAUSE OF DEMAND! I will post your name on all the Boards that I use. You are a DEADBEAT seller! Just by posting this I found a seller who would Honor YOUR Price. I will post his name for honoring YOUR price.  Lets see what you get out of this! Sincerely, Bob

**ANGRY MAN #2**

He wanted a single stack hard to find pistol that is in very short supply nationally. I have two on my shelves. My price reflects demand. I make him a quote on Sunday AM and he asked me to make some changes. Get him a different extended mag, give me a discount, etc etc. This goes on for three days. By Wednesday afternoon everything has gone crazy. He asked me if he could come over and pick it up at the quoted price. 

I explained to him that demand has shifted and my accessibility to product has changed. I would not honor the quote. Basically what it came down to was who would pay sales tax. First quote I said I'd eat it. After the events of this week I said I'm not eating $36 to make a sale, if you want it you're going to pay the tax. 

""You quoted me those prices only two days ago and never did you specify that they were valid for that day only. I was taught by my parents that if i give someone my word that it is as good as any written contract but perhaps it is my fault for expecting that from others in today's society. All I can say is that I'm extremely disappointed and you will certainly never be considered as a source for future firearm purchases by any member of my family. I hope you have a Merry Christmas""
 
Oh well. 

This is what's happening. I can look online, work up a quote and by the time the guy comes in to do the 4473 - the price isn't valid or the market has shifted. As I write this, PMAGS are still selling at $50 each, Colt 6920's have sold for as high as $2000, SCAR 17's have sold for as high as $5000. 

These prices are on gun broker. A lot of new registered users. The conspiracy theory in me is wondering if dealers are using shill accounts to give the illusion of higher selling prices. If I was a dishonest gun dealer (I think most of you know by now I am honest to a fault, if anything) thats something I would do. 

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ME, FC? I AM ASKING ONLY WORKMANS WAGES I COME LOOKING FOR A JOB BUT I GET NO OFFERS?!?!?!?!?**

Simply put, it means prices are going up. Distributors are eliminating discounting and price breaks because they don't have to offer it anymore.

Some vendors are extending allocated items. One vendor I deal with allocated items BY BRAND. Anything Glock? Allocated. Any ammo? Allocated. Anything from Magpul? Allocated. They are revising this on a day by day basis and as of last night a bunch of things came OFF allocation but still, restricting accessibility to product is going to be a big problem. 

If I cannot get any Glock 19's, or anything else - prices are going to 2008 levels, or higher. 

A lot of people are going to call a $800 Glock 19 price gouging. BECAUSE GUN DEALERS ARE EVIL. Okay, yes we're evil and they have a point, but there's a reason. When there is no product to sell, there's no profit to be made. 

A small firearm enterprise with two people working + owner can easily have an overhead of several thousand dollars a month in overhead. If they can't get product to sell, the landlord and the electric company is not going to care and that product they have to sell on their shelves are going to have to tide them over until they get more. 

Sure, they might make $3500 selling 100 PMAGS at $50 each - but that's not sustainable. That $3500 has to last them until they get another delivery. Could be a week, could be a year. Nobody can tell at this point. 

**WHAT ARE MANUFACTURERS DOING TO FIX THIS?**

Not sure. I talked to a few vendors today and they're doing their best to keep product rolling but they are in a position to dictate who gets what to sell.

I am dealer direct with one name brand manufacturer and they have instituted the following sales policy.

Order a rifle, order a pistol. They will not take any order any other way. If you don't buy a pistol, they will not sell you a rifle. They are capping magazine sales at two per order. So if you order a pistol, you are only able to get TWO magazines. If they run out of magazines they will ship guns without magazines and you can't do anything about it. 

**Personal thoughts:**

This is BAD for the industry. Price shocks are bad for ANY commoditized industry. That small gun dealer that just opened up? He's in for some problems. If he started out a month ago and can't get product, he's not going to make any money and close the doors. 

I've got a handful of black rifles on the shelf, and I might sell them and double and triple my money. Great! More power to you! Go capitalism! Right? Wrong. Even if I double my money and I don't get any more in for a year, how do you expect to make a living? This is bad. 

High net worth individuals and well financed speculators are running the table. That S&amp;W Optics Ready Carbine that I had priced at $875 that nobody wanted to buy? Sold for $1200 on Tuesday. The guys who get screwed are the guys who don't have money, business as usual. 

There is NO INCENTIVE to discount anything right now. People are buying what they can get, not what they want. Don't expect dealers to cut you a break. 

I think that vendors are going to tighten their credit. They don't need to finance people to make sales. Their finance department might say: Why should we wait 90 days to get paid when the dealer is going to flip that and make $2300 a gun tomorrow? We should get paid now!

Stripped lowers have an asking price of 400-500 from certain dealers. I expect this to be the new normal. 

Any questions?

92,2012-03-12 11:11:50,Hey Reddit! Can you help me with my positive book about atheists? Help me show that we can have joy and meaning in our lives!,"Hey Reddit!

I need your help!

I'm currently working on a photography project about atheists.  The project involves creating and publishing a 200+ page, hardcover photography book featuring portraits of atheists from around the world.  It's called, *A Better Life: 100 Atheists Speak Out on Joy and Meaning in a World Without God*. I've already got some big names on board to participate, like **Derren Brown, Dr. Carolyn Porco, Dr. Daniel Dennett, Julia Sweeney, Dr. Michael Shermer, Dr. Steven Pinker, Matt Dillahunty, Alex Honnold, Dr. PZ Myers, and Dr. Lawrence Krauss** to name a few. 

Why am I doing this? The book is a response to widespread hatred and distrust of atheists. The widespread perception is that we are immoral, untrustworthy, loveless, sad, lonely, and purposeless. This project will testify to the goodness and beauty possible in the lives of non-believers. It's not an atheist bible or a how-to book. This project is to show the diversity within our community and the various ways different people (even some with whom we may not always agree) have joy and purpose in their lives, contrary to what most religious people think.

I'm holding a fundraiser on Kickstarter to finance the considerable cost of creating, printing, shipping, fees, etc for the book.  When pledging, people aren't just giving money, they have the opportunity to pre-order the book and get some other great rewards for their financial pledge.

I'm almost one-third of the way there, having raised $27,112, or 29% of the goal so far. There are 27 days left in this campaign and as you may know, Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing deal. The book will not be funded in any amount if the campaign fails to meet its goal. Clearly, there is great interest in the message of this book, though time is running out.

I know, if this makes it to the front page of Reddit, enough people will see it to and contribute to make this happen. I know the audience is out there. I'm honestly trying to make a difference here, put a positive face on my community, and show how great atheists around the world can be.

You can find the Kickstarter site and more information here:[http://kck.st/yqjanM](http://kck.st/yqjanM)

Thanks for listening! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to let me know below!

Chris

TL;DR: I'm creating a positive book about atheists. I'm 29% funded, and time is running out for the fundraiser. Even if you can't contribute financially, upvote or let your friends know about this so it can become a reality.

93,2012-01-07 05:38:18,coding while high,"So, I tend to do a lot of programming and I stumbled upon this post on 420chan, hopefully you guys find this interesting like I did. 

**Salvia** - Surprisingly mathematical. Has provided good insight for difficult spatial problems. Not sure if it's worth it. 

Language Affinity: Assembly 

Subject Affinity: Telecommunications/DSP 

**Coffee + Cannabis** - Creativity steroids. +10 WIS -5 INT. You might not be able to show the code to an uptight person without a bit of QA, however. It may also reveal to your inner coding process minus the social bullshit you're always putting through it, allowing you to observe your intrinsic weaknesses and strengths without being able to compensate by sheer speed of wit. In other words, you can't rely on clockspeed quite as much, so you have to rely on intuition and ingenuity. There is also the ocassional ""big bang"" where you gain Carl Sagan super powers and do something amazing. Unfortunately, this is not something that can be reproduced at will.

Feels like programming in: Shader Code 

Subject Affinity: Graphcs, Games 

**Tryptamines/Psilocybin** - Again, not actually practical to code during the trip (Although if you try and it could be very fun, especially if you have a colorful IDE...). There's a weird affect with the tryptamines I like to call the ""abstraction enlargment effect"". Basically, you can easily visualize a system you would have needed to diagram normally. For scientific coding, I think this is the best ability to have over raw precision. 

Feels like programming in: Lisp 

Subject Affinity: Graphics, Science 

**DXM** - Code cannot be created efficiently, although ideas for code can be had. Good for debugging difficult problems where a lot of thought devotion is necessary. Everything has to be coordinated really well. 

Feels like programming in: a really laggy terminal with a terrible connection 

Subject Affinity: Debugging, Architecture 

**Methamphetamines** - Productivity steroids. +10 INT -5 WIS. You will code. YOU WILL CODE. It will be like masturbation. Yessss.

Feels like programming in: C 

Subject Affinity: Driver code, IO 

**Modafinil** - You will no longer need to sleep, but you will also no longer care about boring, repetitive tasks. You'll be a shell of the human you once were, but you'll still be productive, maybe not as smart. 

Feels like programming in: SQL Stored Procedures 

Subject Affinity: Databases, DALs 

**Cocaine** - Code in powder form. And it's code ""the man"" will probably like. However, addiction and dependency is a bitch, you will act like an asshole, etc, etc. Your mileage may vary (you may just get bored as hell and go do more coke, I dunno man). 

Feels like programming in: C# 

Subject Affinity: Finance, commerce 

**Alcohol** - Surprisingly, good supplement in small amounts. Adds a bit more ""fuck it"" to your code, but it turns out a lot of the time you don't need to do a lot of the bullshit you set out to do anyway. Past the Ballmer threshold, it results in sweaty arguments and death marches. 

Feels like programming in: C++ 

Subject Affinity: Games, Input, User Experience 

**Anything Opi** - Terrible for coding. You won't give a fuck about code or anything anyway. 

Feels like programming in: Microsoft Excel, because who gives a fuck about your spreadsheet easter egg. Really. 

Subject Affinity: Documentation, because who gives a fuck ? 

**MDMA** - Impossible to fucking code on, perhaps possible to code while fucking ? (More research is necessary).

Feels like programming in: A room made of breasts 

Subject Affinity: Porn Sites ? 

**Caffeine + Mescaline** - Very easy to code in, you probably won't find yourself distracted and will be able to maintain focus. Has many of the advantages of tryptamine with a little bit of cocaine.

Feels like programming in: C++0x 

Subject Affinity: High Performance Computing, Kernel Programming, Engineering 


**LSA (HBWR)** - Kinda like tryptamines, but held back by a sluggish feeling.

Feels like: Java

Subject: Web Services

**SSRIs &amp; Benzos** - Boring as shit. Suburban. Socially acceptable.

Feels like: JavaScript

Me: ""It worked perfectly when I tested it"".

And off he went. Not more than a few hours later he called in and complained he couldn't use the VPN. That sounded strange, given that the program was the same that he used on his old computer.
I sent him an e-mail explaining what to do. 

Charles reply with :""I don't understand your IT jargon, make it simpler"".

So I write a new e-mail and explains very clearly what information to use. (Remember he has used this program many times before).

New e-mail ticks in, CC to my boss and several other higher-ups explaining that he is very angry that I am no good at my job.
