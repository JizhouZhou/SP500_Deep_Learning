3,2012-01-01 16:38:29,Investing 100K,"I'll preface this by stating I've read the FAQs. It's great general advice, but I'm looking for some concrete recommendations. About me:

- Male, 30
- ~250k mortgage remaining
- new car, paid off
- no other debt
- maxed out 401k contribution
- 100k in ""high interest"" .7% savings account, adding ~4k a month after expenses

I've come to realize I'm a bit lazy about finance and investing - I just lack interest in the subject. I'd like to find something that I can just dump money into and forget about. I've held index ETFs and mutual funds in the past, but they seem a bit too volatile to just ignore for long periods of time. Ideally I'd like something more aggressive than a savings account, but safe enough to automatically transfer money into every month. "
4,2012-01-01 17:42:27,"Received $11,000 in Savings Bonds at Christmas. Which debts do I pay off first?","Hi personal finance! I was going to post this in r/frugal, but this seems to be the better option to ask for advice. As the title says, I recently received $11,000 dollars in savings bonds that were opened for me when I was born. I didn't know this money existed, and frankly I think my parents forgot it did as well. Regardless, it's quite a sum of money to fall into my hands. I'm looking for some advice on how to spend it-- I won't be purchasing anything ""for me"" but rather, using it to eliminate as much debt as possible.

The breakdown is this: 

* I have $7,053 left on a car payment. It was a three year loan (at 4.9% interest), and I purchased the car in January of 2011. 
* I have ~3,000 in credit card 'debt', but this card will remain interest free until September of 2012. (the amount/balance is so high do to me moving to a different state/job and the costs involved with that).
* I have $51,000 in private student loan debt, which I have not consolidated. I've consistently been making the minimum payments ($400) for the past two years, and will occasionally pay more depending on available money. The interest rates on my loans are both under 5%. 

* I save $100 of every paycheck and put it into a 'rainy day' fund. That fund is up to $1200 currently. 

* Lastly, $7,000 of the loans just accrued interest in the last few months, meaning the next time they'll accrue is awhile away. The other $4,000 will accrue at the end of January, and again 6 months later (I think).

My plan, as of now, is to pay off the remainder of my car loan, so that I can eliminate a $300/month recurring payment + eliminate the interest accruing from that. After that, I was going to take the other 4,000 dollars (that will accrue more interest in January) and pay off my credit card completely, so that I can just pay off my card in full month to month. However, as this card won't actually start accumulating interest until September... I'm wondering if I should wait until the $4,000 accrues more interest in June before cashing those bonds. 

My biggest question is, ""how do I spend the remaining $4,000?"" For my loans, I already will have a built in $300 extra lying around that I can now throw at it due to my car payment being eliminated... so I just don't know if I should get my card balance to 0, eliminating ALL of my low level debts... or wait for the bond to accrue interest twice before tackling it. If I'm leaving out any necessary information, please let me know and I'll do my best to reply quickly. Thanks!"

6,2012-01-01 15:20:27,What's some financial advice for someone who's entering the real world after having relied on his/her parents?,"I'm a recent college graduate, and I need help on how to become financially independent. I've been grateful enough to have parents who have paid for everything for me so far, including my college tuition, but now that I've graduated and am entering the real world, I figure that I need to set a basis for myself if I'm gonna survive in this world.

I have a Bank of America debit card that my parents made for me when I was going to college, but based on advice from fellow Redditors, it looks like I'm gonna close my BoA account and seek a local credit union. Any websites or advice on how to find one?

Also, I know almost nothing about having a credit score. I've been using a credit card under my parents' account, so I should probably set up my own account to get my own card, too. Any advice for that?

I took a personal finance class during my last semester of college, but being the arrogant prick I was, I didn't pay much attention, but I know there are different investment/saving methods like stocks, bonds, retirement funds, blah blah. If anyone has any links or tips on how to get started with those too, that would be dandy.

**TL;DR** Need advice on finding a local credit union, making my own credit card, and investing money for the future."
7,2012-01-01 22:28:40,Pros and Cons of Allowing a Bill to Go to Collection,"I have 500 dollars unpaid to a Sorority through billhighway.com.
I tried to de-activate before the 500 dollar became overdue and thus avoid being required to pay it, but through bureaucracy and really late paperwork (not through any fault of my own), i now am 500 dollars overdue. 
The head of finance of my sorority has set out a reasonable payment plan for me over the next 3 months, saying that if i pay it then they wont report my information to a collection agency even though they payments are extremely late and on top of that they wont charge any late fees.
I was planning on using my Christmas money to pay it off. 

HOWEVER, i was talking to my brother today, and he urged me not to pay it.
He says that it wasn't my fault. He also doesn't believe they will send the information to a collection agency.
AND if they did, i could bargain with the agency and pay off the bill at a fraction of the cost. 

He reasons that i'm only 19 and my credit is already going to suck because of my age and the amount owed is not that much. He also said that this, if reported will only stay on my credit report for 5 years.

He said that my credit score couldn't possibly be adversely affected by not paying this amount as any loans i try to obtain would need a co-signer anyway for the next couple of years.

I know $500 dollars might not sound like a lot to some people, but i'm on 100% financial aid at school and my wages from my job goes to keeping me housed and fed; $500 this semester can really help towards books and other essentials. 


Can someone please tell me if everything my brother said is true?
The thought of not paying the amount never even occurred to me until today.

8,2012-01-01 15:19:33,Question about automatic (scheduled) electronic payments,"I was reading [this blog post from Get Rich Slowly]( http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2008/05/20/my-paperless-personal-finance-system-a-work-in-progress/) and had a question about scheduled, automatic electronic payments.

&gt;Iâ€™ve set up electronic statements and payments for all my bills. Every month, I receive an e-mail notice from each company that my statement is ready. I verify that the bill is correct. If I were to find an error (none so far), I would cancel the scheduled electronic payment and contact the company to correct the problem. Most of my bills are set to be paid automatically.

I understand how this works for bills that are consistent each month (maybe internet or cable), but how does it work for bills that are different each month (e.g. electric bill)? Would it just pay the same amount each month ($80, let's say), and it would slowly build your balance if it were more (or credit you if it were less)?

Or is he referring to automatic debit? Where the company automatically withdraws the money."

I have a car which helps alot.

I want to avoid appartaments if possible. So I know where I am going. I already had a girlfriend for 3 years, she was my first and she decided to broke up with me 1 year and a half ago. Everything is fine now, and I am looking for a new girl or girlfriend (nothing serious for the moment), (we are all guys and I think we can all get a cute girl without looking for a playmate). I am doing some cold approaches, online dating sites, clubs etc.. and then we are going together for a coffee or a drink.

-You have to understand that I don't feel confortable to bring random girls at home after a club or bar, cuz my parents are there, nor having an one night stand. 

-Another aspect that I have noticed after dating some girls, is that when she is cute (from 7 to 9) she want a certain level of confort, so when she learns that I live with parents, that I have a part time job, she becomes reluctant to start something with me, even if i explain to her my future plans. 
Correct me if I am wrong, but I think these types of girls prefer the ""not serious guy"" or the douchebag who lives in an appartment, got a little job and a car, because he is more ""independant"". 

Personnaly after few approaches, I would like to say that I don't like schoolgirls from University because the majority is too focused on school. I am quite similar when exams are near, however this quote describe me well ""Work hard, Play Hard"" This is why i try to find girls who work and relax after that, but also with a minimum of understanding. Which means that most of the time I feel powerless due to my situation and it gives me serious problems with my selfconfidence, I don't have major problems to approach girls, but I can't escalate it to another level, after the first few dates. I am not a pushover, too needy, or giving too much affection.

The speech with be after dinner and we are allotted 5-10 min, so it should be relatively quick.

However, I dont want it to only be about medicine since a lot (and i mean A LOT) of people at my school go into finance, consulting, start-ups, non-profits, etc. Ultimately, the goal is to keep it interesting and relevant for everyone.

I was also hoping to get some pointers in terms of the presentation itself. Since there are two of us, does anyone have any clever ideas about some demonstration we could do quickly or an interesting way to deliver the speech that would capture its teamwork/multidisciplinary essence?

I've been to Harvey Norman today and can get a King Koil King sized bed (with under bed drawers) for about $2550 on 12 months int. free; which I am pretty happy with since the starting price was considerably higher ($3200). It felt great though and it was the bed we were most happy with so far...

Then we went to Farmers and they have Sleepyhead beds for 40% discount - looked at the Sleepyhead Balance Trent bed - no under bed storage but costs only $1900 delivered. The non discounted price of this bed is higher than that of the King Koil, but I can't help but feel that is just marketing bullcrap because the Kingcoil felt much better...

http://www.ahbeard.com/product/king-koil
http://www.sleepyhead.co.nz/collections/beds/pocket-spring/

These are the two beds, in a nut shell... we tried a King Koil at another bed store and it was awful, but the Harvey Norman one (which is made exclusively for Harvey Norman) is really nice...



**Edit:** Oh heck people just love the downvote button...

An update to what I ended up doing - didn't get either beds - went with the advice of superiority to ignore the non discounted prices - and picked up a Sealy mattress with pocket springs, latex, all natural materials, feels amazing and ended up shelling out $1500 for mattress only, and will throw it on my current slat frame. Didn't need finance in the end either, so win all round. 

Pretty happy, I think this was by far the best way to do it - and my chiropractor recommended a slat frame because you then don't need to replace the base with the mattress (because the non slat frame mattresses are designed to be swapped apparently...).

Thanks for the help - though it wasn't quite the expert opinions I was hoping for, the general advice was great and helped!"
